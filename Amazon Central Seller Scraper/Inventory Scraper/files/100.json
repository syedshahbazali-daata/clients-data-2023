    "description": "Votaniki Ranunculus flowers look almost too perfect to be real. Their rose-like blossoms feature layer upon layer of tissue-thin petals. Though not often seen in home gardens, the exquisite flowers of ranunculus are a staple in high-end flower shops and wedding bouquets. If you're a fan of ranunculus, why not try growing them yourself? The corms can be planted in containers or in a garden so you can enjoy their beautiful blooms both indoors and out. Growing ranunculus outdoors is easy! In zones 8 and warmer, plant ranunculus bulbs in the fall. In colder zones, plant in spring. It takes between 2-3 months for spring planted ranunculus to bloom after planting. Choose a spot for your ranunculus where the soil drains well. If you see that water still puddles 5 to 6 hours after a hard rain, find another spot. You can amend the soil, instead, by adding organic matter, at least 2 to 3 inches of it, to improve drainage. You can find peat moss, compost, ground bark, or decomposed manure pretty much anywhere; all work great. It’s always easiest to start with a good spot that you know they’ll like, though. Plant bulbs 4-6 inches apart, 2-3 inches deep. Water after planting to encourage bulbs to establish roots. Refrain from watering again until you see leaves sprouting.",

    "description": "Votaniki Cora Louise - Itoh Peony large, semi-double blossoms, white with striking dark lavender central flares, stand above lush, toothed foliage. Flowers have a soft, pleasing scent and are a wonderful addition to any spring bouquet. An especially vigorous plant – it can produce up to 50 blooms in a single season; the sturdy flower stems require no staking Deep green foliage is divided into lance-shaped segments. Foliage remains attractive throughout the growing season. Plants die back to the ground after fall frost. Cora Louise easily grow in rich, fertile, medium moisture, well-drained soils in full sun to part shade. Cora Lewis flowers are particularly vigorous plants, multiplying very quickly. Cora Louise flowers are superb for flower arrangements. This hardy perennial is an intersectional hybrid – a cross which marries the exotic looks of tree peonies with the herbaceous growth habit of herbaceous peonies, and often called an Itoh Peony. A lovely addition to cottage garden planting schemes. Height: 75cm (29\"). Spread: 90cm (36\").",

    "description": "Votaniki David Howard Dahlia is a stunning flowering perennial that will add a pop of color and beauty to any garden. With its vibrant orange-red blooms and dark purple foliage, it is a true showstopper. This variety of Dahlia is a compact grower, reaching a height of 18-24 inches with a similar spread, making it a perfect choice for small gardens or container planting. The flowers of the David Howard Dahlia measure approximately 3-4 inches in diameter and are produced in abundance from mid-summer until the first frost. Not only is this plant visually stunning, but it is also easy to care for. The David Howard Dahlia prefers full sun to partial shade and well-draining soil. Regular watering and fertilization will promote healthy growth and a prolonged flowering period. David Howard Dahlia plant is hardy in USDA Zones 8-10, but can also be grown as an annual in cooler climates. It is a relatively low-maintenance plant that requires regular deadheading to encourage continuous blooming. In addition, staking may be necessary to keep the plant from drooping under the weight of its heavy blooms. One of the most unique features of the David Howard Dahlia is its dark purple foliage. The leaves are deeply cut and provide a beautiful contrast to the bright orange-red flowers. This stunning color combination makes the plant an eye-catching addition to any garden, whether planted alone or in combination with other plants.",

They prefer well-draining soil and a sunny or partially shaded location. Keep the soil consistently moist, but not waterlogged, especially during the first growing season. If you live in a colder climate, protect the base of the plant with a mulch layer for the winter. Peonies can be divided every 4-5 years to maintain their vigor and to propagate new plants.

    "description": "Bartzella is a yellow Itoh peony variety, which is a type of peony that is a cross between a tree peony and a herbaceous peony. It is known for its large, yellow flowers and vigorous growth. Bartzella is a hardy and long-lived plant, and is well suited to a wide range of growing conditions. It is typically planted in the fall, and will bloom in late spring or early summer. It can be planted in a sunny or partially shaded location, and prefers well-drained soil. It is also low maintenance. Peonies are classic garden plants that add a bit of nostalgia and charm to the garden. The fragrant blooms and lush foliage made them popular for years and with the resurgence in breeding, they will continue to improve. Another successful crossing of a tree peony and a bush peony, this incredible Itoh variety delivers extra-large, uniquely yellow blooms on a robust, winter-hardy plant. Strong stems hold the fragrant, 6-8\" flowers upright, even after a heavy rain! Glossy, green foliage starts out copper-burgundy in the spring and provides interest throughout the season. Expect up to 80 gorgeous blooms per season!",

    "description": "The Votaniki O'Neal Blueberry Bush is fruit-bearing shrub that is perfect for gardeners looking to add a delicious and nutritious addition to their backyard. One of the most important features of the O'Neal Blueberry Bush is its ability to produce a large number of blueberries each year. These berries are sweet and juicy, with a bright blue color that makes them perfect for eating fresh or using in a variety of recipes. Because this plant is self-pollinating, it does not require another blueberry bush to produce fruit. In addition to its delicious fruit, the O'Neal Blueberry Bush is also known for its attractive foliage. The leaves are a deep green color, with a glossy sheen that adds a touch of elegance to any garden. As the plant matures, it will develop a rounded shape that is both attractive and functional, providing plenty of shade for other plants in the area. O'Neal Blueberry plant can grow in a variety of soil types but prefers well-draining soil. This plant is tolerant to drought and heat. It is also known for its cold hardiness, making it a great choice for gardeners in colder climates who want to grow blueberries. As the plant grows, it may require some pruning to maintain its shape and size. Pruning can also help to promote more fruit production and ensure that the plant stays healthy. The O'Neal Blueberry Bush can grow up to 6 feet tall and 4 feet wide, so it is important to give it enough space to grow and spread. When caring for the O'Neal Blueberry Bush, it is important to provide it with regular watering and fertilization. It is recommended to fertilize this plant with an acid fertilizer, as blueberries prefer acidic soil. Additionally, it is important to protect the plant from birds, which may try to eat the fruit. This can be done by using netting or other protective measures.",

    "description": "The Blue Wish dahlia with its incredible ornamental flowers will light up the end of the garden season. The subtle combination of white with the purple-blue petal tips add freshness to every setting. These vigorous plants produce lavish green foliage. Flowers develop atop the up to 120 centimetres tall stems. You can admire them in the second half of summer and at the beginning of autumn. Vigorous dahlias are plants worth growing in every home garden. They will pass the test as border plants and those grown in groups on lawns. Due to its height, dahlia can be used as garden dividers and cover for less attractive plot parts. Permeable and fertile soils suit dahlia the most. Make sure to regularly water soils. You should remove wilted flowers to stimulate dahlias to more abundant and long lasting blooming. Dahlia will adorn your garden for years to come if you dig out its frost sensitive rootstock after the end of each season. Roughly cleaned and dried dahlia tubers should be stored in a dry, ventilated room that is well protected from frost. Storing dahlia rootstock in baskets or airy boxes, layered with peat or sawdust, proves to be most convenient. Plant the rootstock again after the last frost in spring.",

The flowers bloom in mid to late summer, providing a splash of color to your garden when other plants may have stopped blooming. These plants are hardy and can thrive in a variety of conditions. They prefer well-drained soil and plenty of sunshine, but they can also tolerate some shade. In addition to their beauty and ease of care, Orange Perfection Phlox flowers also have a lovely fragrance that will fill your garden with a sweet, spicy scent. This makes them a popular choice for adding sensory interest to any outdoor space. Orange Perfection Phlox roots are perennials, meaning they will come back year after year with proper care. They are also a great choice for attracting pollinators, such as bees and butterflies, to your garden, as the brightly colored blooms are a favorite of these important insects. When planting Orange Perfection Phlox roots, it's best to space them about 1-2 feet apart to allow for their mature size.

The bulbs should be planted about 6-8 inches deep and about 18 inches apart. Water well after planting. Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Avoid over watering as it can lead to bulb rot. Fertilize every 4-6 weeks with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer to encourage strong growth and abundant blooming.   See more",

This tree produces fragrant, lavender-pink flowers in the late spring and early summer, which not only look stunning but also give off a delightful fragrance that can fill the air. The 1-gallon plant is a 2-year-old sapling that has been carefully cultivated to ensure that it is strong and healthy. It is ideal for planting in a variety of locations, including garden borders, along driveways or walkways, or as a standalone tree. The Villosa Lilac Tree can reach a height of up to 8-10 feet, making it a great choice for smaller gardens or spaces. The plant is easy to care for and requires little maintenance. It prefers full sun to partial shade and well-drained soil. The Villosa Lilac Tree is a deciduous tree that sheds its leaves in the fall. During the growing season, it produces attractive green foliage that turns yellow in the fall before dropping. The tree is relatively slow-growing, taking several years to reach its full height, but it is well worth the wait. The plant is also relatively low-maintenance, requiring only occasional pruning to maintain its shape and remove dead or damaged branches. This makes it an excellent choice for busy gardeners or those who don't have a lot of time to devote to plant care. Villosa Lilac Tree is also a favorite among gardeners and landscapers for its ability to attract pollinators like butterflies and bees. The fragrant flowers are particularly attractive to these insects, making this tree a great choice for those looking to support local wildlife.",

    "description": "Dinner Plate Dahlia is known for its large, 10-inch blooms. The flowers have a flattened shape, like a dinner plate Purple color. The plant itself can grow to be quite tall, up to 5 feet, and is ideal for the back of a border or as a focal point in a garden bed. It blooms in late summer to fall and its tubers can be saved over winter in cold climates and re-planted the following spring. They are also very popular in cut-flower arrangements. Dinner Plate Dahlias like \"Vancouver\" are cultivars of the species Dahlia hybrida. They are popular for their large, showy blooms and long blooming period, often from late summer to the first frost. These dahlias require full sun and well-drained soil to thrive. They can be susceptible to pests and diseases, but are generally easy to grow and maintain. In terms of care, it is important to plant the tubers of dinner plate dahlias about 8 inches deep and 3 feet apart. They require regular watering and fertilization, especially once they start to bloom. Deadheading, or removing spent flowers, can help prolong the blooming period. Dinner plate dahlias are also popular cut flowers, they can last up to a week in a vase, and they can be brought inside to enjoy their beauty.",
