They grow to a height of 3-4 feet, and produce large and striking blooms of striking red and white color. The blooms are semi-cactus type and can reach up to 6 inches in diameter. The plant typically begins blooming in mid-summer and continues to bloom until the first frost. Dahlias have a tuberous root system and should be planted in well-drained soil in a sunny location. They should be planted at the same depth as the tubers and spaced about 2-3 feet apart. They need regular watering and fertilization. They are relatively low maintenance, however, they benefit from deadheading spent blooms, staking, and disbudding to promote bigger blooms. You can over-winter dahlia tubers in a dry, cool place and then replant them in the spring. Or you can also dig up the tubers after the first frost and store them in a dry, cool place over winter.","isAvailable":true,"totalImages":3,"totalVideos":0,"This dataset is limited":"Get our subscription https://scrape-it.cloud to see the full dataset"},{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSR4GXBY","asin":"B0BSR4GXBY","brand":"Brand: Votaniki","price":{"priceAmount":27.98,"currencySymbol":"$"},"title":"Votaniki Dahlia Decorative Dynamite Bulbs - Double Blooms and Striking Appearance Bulbs, Long-Blooming Dahlia, Easy to Grow (2 Pack)","badges":{"bestSeller":false,"amazonPrime":true,"amazonChoice":false},"images":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/719MzPIoowL._AC_SL1276_.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51qcv+VlTBL._AC_.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Jcq3d9Y-L._AC_.jpg"],"videos":[],"details":{},"reviews":{"rating":0,"totalReviews":0,"answeredQuestions":0},"features":["Large, double blooms: The flowers of 'Decorative Dynamite' are large and double, with red color and White.","Vibrant color: The bright red and White color of this variety makes it a standout in any garden or flower bed.","Easy to grow: This variety is relatively easy to care for and can be grown in a variety of soil types and climates.","Continual blooming: With regular deadheading, the plant will bloom continually from mid-summer to fall.","Drought tolerant: Once established, it can withstand dry spells, which makes it a good option for gardeners in areas with low rainfall.","Cut flower: Decorative Dynamite dahlia can be used as a cut flower and can be used to add a pop of color to bouquets and floral arrangements.","Versatile: Decorative Dynamite dahlia can be grown in the ground, in pots or planters with proper drainage, as well as in container gardens, which makes it a versatile option for any gardener."],"overview":{"brand":"Votaniki","color":"Red and White","soil type":"Well-drained","unit count":"2.0 Count","sunlight exposure":"Full Sun","usda hardiness zone":"8 to 11","expected blooming period":"Summer","expected planting period":"Spring","product care instructions":"(function(f) {var _np=(window.P._namespace(\"DetailPageProductOverviewTemplatesJava\"));if(_np.guardFatal){_np.guardFatal(f)(_np);}else{f(_np);}}(function(P) {\n                                    P.when('A').execute(function(A){\n                                        A.on('a:truncate:po-attribute-truncate-7:updated', function(data) {\n                                            var isTruncated = !data.truncateInstance.getIfTextFits();\n                                            var seeMoreElement = document.getElementById('po-attribute-see-more-id-7');\n                                            if(seeMoreElement) {\n                                                seeMoreElement.style.display = isTruncated ?
