The Dahlia Pastel Mix bulbs that you mentioned are a great option for those who want a variety of pastel colored flowers in their garden. These bulbs will produce a range of dahlia flowers in shades such as pink, lavender, and white. When planting dahlia bulbs, it is important to choose a sunny location with well-drained soil. The bulbs should be planted about 4-6 inches deep and spaced about 18-24 inches apart. Watering and fertilizing regularly will help promote healthy growth and abundant blooming. Dahlias are generally easy to care for, but they can be susceptible to pests and diseases such as powdery mildew, aphids, and slugs. Regularly inspecting the plants and treating any issues promptly can help prevent problems. Deadheading, or removing spent blooms, can also encourage the plants to produce more flowers.","isAvailable":true,"totalImages":2,"totalVideos":0,"This dataset is limited":"Get our subscription https://scrape-it.cloud to see the full dataset"},{"url":"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BSXLH6KC","asin":"B0BSXLH6KC","brand":"Brand: Votaniki","price":{"priceAmount":35.98,"currencySymbol":"$"},"title":"Votaniki Honey Gold Peony Bulbs for Planting - Fragrant, Spectacular Large Peony Flowering Bulbs | Hardy and Easy to Grow, Long Blooming Peony Flower Plant (1 Pack)","badges":{"bestSeller":false,"amazonPrime":true,"amazonChoice":false},"images":["https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/512tMZxP8sL._AC_.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51L1OZaFHhL._AC_.jpg","https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61+sAfoJvmL._AC_.jpg"],"videos":[],"details":{},"reviews":{"rating":0,"totalReviews":0,"answeredQuestions":0},"features":["Fragrant blooms.
