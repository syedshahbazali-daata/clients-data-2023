"A genuinely Budget friendly Hotel and exceptional employees , clean and older decors in room and suites.
However they are currently remolding spa and swimming pool , area .
When you enter the lobby area ,you may hear some  really nice Jazz music  and a fireplace  and a feel of positive energy and relaxation as you go through the check in process.
Ms. R and the rest of her working professionals are genuinely pleasant and the Cleaning staff and Maintenance personnel are hard workers day in and day out.

This is the worst hotel you would ever try going to this hotel is nasty and especially they don’t even offer refunds I didn’t even go to the hotel and couldn’t get a refund back I waited 3 weeks for nothing this hotel is literally the bottom of the barrel when it comes to finding places would not recommend to anyone don’t book here and if you do and try to get your refund back good luck,Lam2swae,2022-11-06
"I like to start with a positive - great location near the freeway and SNA airport.  
That is it.  This is the only reason I gave ANY stars.

I am going to directly address issues from Quality Inn's ""Your Satisfaction"" card that was on our table in the room.   I brought the card home with me.

Commitment to your satisfaction - Any issue was completely ignored or unaddressed.
I asked for a washcloth to be delivered to the room - never arrived.  
They make nothing right.

Commitment to clean - Filthy place, including dog feces on the property, stacks of beer cans/trash, disgusting ""spa,"" piles of dirt in carpet corners, and the list goes on.
Even the elevators were terrible.  You would need a prescription of antibiotics prior to go in to the pool.  Threadbare dingy linens.

Forgot something?  ""...Ask front desk and we'll be glad to help..."" 
I asked for a plastic fork, a fresh towel (sorry they are all dirty), etc.  

Room to be Green - Linens replaced every third day unless you ask?  Hello?  No one told me this upon check-in.  In three days we never had one single housekeeping thing done.  I wouldn't trust that anyway.

Bed - Hard as a rock 

Breakfast  - And I quote DIRECTLY from their room card...""Start your day right with a complimentary hot, fresh and health breakfast.""  UHHH...not even WATER was available in the lobby.  ""GO TO MCDONALD'S"" is what I was told for coffee or food, as all they had was an old pastry in a grab and go bag.  

Service - Horrid.  Rude and ignorant people.  

Essentials - And AGAIN I quote....""Get the value you deserve with free Wifi (DID NOT WORK), newspaper (NONE), tea and coffee""...one lousy pack..However, there is an in-room fridge.  That was actually true!  

I complained upon check-out, and was told ""sorry"" and ""I will tell the manager"" who was of course not there when I asked to see him or her.  

This is an outrage.  I truly feel this hotel is one of  those freebies to addicts/homeless also.  Lots of sketchy men hanging around at night.  

I intend to take this issue to higher levels.  I want nothing but to warn the general public to stay away.  I would never enter a ""Quality Inn"" anywhere again on this planet.",H354BPkimberlys,2022-08-29
"Poorly maintained, dirty, I would not stay here again.   Unless I was looking for a Hooker. Pool was green  with algae,.  So was the 'spa'.  No thumbs up.    I booked with hotels.com. Disappointed.  No house keeping unless you ask prior day. No breakfast.  Probably just as well.   There is a McDonald's next door.",robertnH2199NP,2022-07-04
"I had damage done to my car by another guest who tossed a burning cigarette from there 3rd floor balcony and landing on  the roof of my car  and left a big brown spot . Most of it buffed off but there is still a very small spot burn in the paint.  Still it should not have happen .  Did report and did have a desk clerk look at before I left and still 
 I have not heard back from a manger . 5 days now . Does anyone care at this hotel ?  Wonder if they would care if that burning cigarette would have landed in the dry flower bed and started the hotel on fire and guests got hurt ??  I would not have expected this from a $125.00 night Hotel. I did contact Choice hotels.",642richarde,2022-05-23
"It’s basic basic but does the job for a 1 night stay. Nice to have a small Chinese food restaurant attached but you can walk to several other options. Pool yes, but hot tub, no! The free breakfast was “grab and go”, so basically a few things to microwave and a bottle of water. 
Book via a travel site (vs their web site) and save $20, but you won’t get points for your stay.

"OK first thing when I arrived I knew it was bad. The parking garage was filled with homeless people, drug dealers, etc. The door into the hotel had a sign that read ""please use room key to unlock"" but there was not a lock on the door it looks like it had been stolen and the door opened without a room key needed. I walked through what looked like a hallway out of a horror movie with trash cracked tiles and flickering lights to the elevator. While I was checking in the woman working the front desk said probably no more than 5 words to me. I asked about the price match policy that was on the website and she said they don't do it. When I got to my room it was clearly dirty, like instead of changing the sheets the housekeepers just made the bed. All the furniture looks like it has been there since the 70s, scratches everywhere, and visibly disgusting. The fridge and microwave were the oldest appliances that I have ever seen, they could not have been less than 30 years old. The next thing I notice is that the lock on the door to the room seemed to not be working. I called Quality Inn customer service to report how gross the room was. While on the phone with customer service I get a call on the phone in the room from the front desk and they tell me I have 5 minutes to get out of the hotel. I go to the front desk to talk this over and be moved to a clean room and the manager Linda starts screaming at me telling me to leave accusing me of lying about the state of the room. I asked if I would get all my money back if I left and she said: ""I don't know"". At that point, I knew if I left I would not get my money back. Linda continues to scream and verbally abuse me to the point where I start crying, Linda then instructs me to sit in the lobby and wait. I sit in the lobby crying for almost an hour with no word from anyone. Linda then returns and shows me some other rooms she called VIP rooms. They were identical to the first room. I accept one because there wasn't availability at any other hotels and I was exhausted. Looking back on this stay I honestly think it may have been a better idea to have slept in my car. I kept a list of every problem I had during my stay:
- BUGS EVERYWHERE bathroom, public areas, even in the beds!
-The door onto the balcony DOES NOT LOCK! huge security concern especially with dozens of homeless people in the parking lot
- THE WATER IS BROWN it is obviously unsafe to drink, and they do not provide clean drinking water
- cracks in the walls and tiles
-paint peeling and popcorn ceiling falling off
suspicious stains EVERYWHERE what looked like blood stains on the curtains and poop stains in the carpet
-The key cards stop working if they are near a cell phone, so don't keep it in your purse or pocket
-The ""breakfast"" looks like something they would give you in a public elementary school. inedible microwave burritos and stale raisin snails
- The newspapers in the lobby are extremely right-biased, some of the articles contained straight up lies. 
-The pool breakfast and fitness room are closed even though every other hotel I have seen is open. 

And finally the worst part of my stay, after I checked out and had gotten home I checked my bank account. THEY OVERCHARGED ME BY 100 DOLLARS. I have spent the last 3 days emailing and calling the hotel and corporate and they have done nothing for me. Looking at other reviews and BBB complaints it looks like I am not the only guest they do this to. my guess is they overcharge every guest and just hope you do not notice. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN",phoebsss,2021-06-23
The property is poorly managed.  Avoid at all costs! There were so many problems with this hotel: 1. The older gentleman who checked us in had his mask pulled down to his chin (not covering his mouth or nose) and was constantly coughing. 2. The hotel room had a quarter of a roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. No spare roll. We had to go to front desk to get another roll. 3. The microwave didn’t work. 4. The bathroom faucet leaked a steady stream of water non-stop. Not a trickle but a stream! 5. I am disabled and asked for a room on the main floor in advance but we were given a room on top floor as far away from the lobby as possible. 6. To top it all off: the phone in our room rang at 4:15am. No more sleep for me that night.,LolaHonolulu,2021-06-15
"•	Found two cockroaches in the bathroom during the night. 
•	The non-smoking room smelled like cigarettes. 
•	It looked as though someone threw up from one of the balconies around the pool.  We got there on Friday and it was still not cleaned up when we left on Sunday morning.
•	The “Breakfast” was a breakfast burrito, (the kind that are 3/$1.00), water and a pre-wrapped Danish.
•	The carpet needed cleaning.
•	We could not turn off the water in the bath / shower.
•	The couch had holes and stains.  
•	The furniture was so dirty; I was scared to sit anywhere.",Q5870RXgregm,2021-06-06
"The hotel is not well maintained and I was first greeted by a cranky man who works the overnight shift. I paid an extra $30. to check in early. My room was older, furniture quite beat up, very thin towels, rust around the drains. Then, heard pipes roar and feces started to fill the tub. A pipe burst. I called the front desk and the phone just rings. Then, I get dressed to go to the front and pass a man complaining about the broken ice machine and overflowing lobby trash cans. I return to make coffee in my room and the coffee maker had some crusty food stuffed where the water belongs. 
I have to pack up switch rooms for a non-feces room with clean plumbing, shower. 
The next room looked better except for the paint peeling off the wall and candy wrappers by the nightstand- no idea how housekeeping missed them! 
Breakfast is a frozen Costco breakfast sandwich with a bottle of water.
The manager says I'll be refunded one night, instead, I'm billed for an additional night which I wasn't there for!  After a $100 deposit, and a couple hundred taken off my card that won't be refunded until they process a refund correctly, not charge me for a refund?? And For their error, I was inconvenienced greatly -I am editing a lot because I think I've made my point. This hotel you are always dealing with a rude staff who are unsophisticated, zero customer service, or any care for their job. With a DND sign on your door, they will pound on your door and literally shrug saying ""oh...' 

The worst part, I'm having to go without nearly $400. for many days of my money while their bank processes a refund for funds not authorized to spend! The worst l hotel I've experienced in OC which is a shame because their corporate is so professional and Choice hotel group otherwise seems like a decent brand for basic, clean, average stays.",253jennifery,2021-04-06

"I was looking for a two-night stay in a clean, safe, comfortable, quiet and reasonably priced location near Mission Viejo. I only stayed one night. My room was unmade when I checked in and had to request another room. I have a UV flashlight, and the bed linens and pillows were spotless. Aside from stains on the walls and a dirty towel on the floor in the bathroom, the room was clean. There was no noise from adjoining rooms, but the generator on the outside balcony ran continuously with no way to turn it off. I found the bed mattress to be very hard: my back and both hips were sore and I could not sleep—the primary reason I checked out a day early. I always felt safe, staff were pleasant and helpful, and the room was fairly priced. The breakfast was very good. As other reviewers have stated, the rooms are dated and in dire need of remodeling if management aspires to be more than a two-star hotel. Hard mattress and noisy generators were a huge down-side for me.",dr_cherylc808,2019-08-15

"We had a last minute venue change and had to make a last minute hotel switch. There was only one desk clerk at 3:00 pm when we checked in. So things were slow. The room frankly has seen better days. The nightstand was being propped up by a wooden block and the drawer would not close. One of the drawers on the cabinet looked like it was going to fall off. The real problem came Saturday morning when we awoke to the sound of water running. There was water leaking from the ceiling of our bathroom. When I alerted the front desk they said maintenance would be in after 9:00 am. This was at 7:30 am. The clerk could of cared less and told me management was not available.. So we got dressed and left for our event but packed our bags in case we needed to move. We came back late Saturday night to discover that the water stopped leaking but there were pieces of ceiling in the tub and the wall was wet. So I don't believe anything was done. When I asked the desk , I was met with a blank stair and once again told the maintenence was not available. We gave up and went to bed. We tried one last time on Sunday morning to talk to management and were once again told no one is available. Please spend your money elsewhere. The owners really no not care about their guests.

"I had a reservation for this place last week it was unfortunate when I came in to register the manager Penny Fleming was sitting down at the desk( I thought it was unusual for someone to be siting down) she made no eye contact with me and didn't even say hello.  This rude horrible manager was so disrespectful to me that she just wanted to argue about everything.
Why is a manager sitting behind a check in desk and not managing her motel.
What ever you do please try not to check in to this place before check in at 3pm or you will be rebranded by the manager.
I asked her several times if my room was ready it was 11:15 am and she told me over and over again that check in was at 3pm. She never did respond to my question, she just wanted to pick a fight.
I have stayed in numerous choice hotels throughout the years and never has a problem checking in before 3 pm until I came to this rude manager.
After arguing with me for about 5 minutes she then says she can check me in at noon for additional $10.00.  Why didn't she just tell me that 5 minutes before instead of reprimanding about the check in time.  
She then decided to cancel my reservation and told me I would be happier some where else. 
I told her she was rude and I would be reporting her, she said you go right ahead.

Penny Fleming (Manager)  obviously has no prior management experience in a hotel motel setting, she has no customer service skills and definitely is not out to help her guests.",499debbiel,2018-10-28
"I gave this place 3 stars last time I stayed - now it gets one.
The neighborhood is sketchy believe it or not. I pulled up and two homeless people were hanging out in front. 
The front staff barely made eye contact. The manager walked through the lobby barefoot.
The place needs a makeover BADLY. The ceiling tiles are stained and falling down at the front desk area. The entire place is being held together by a string ! One good California earthquake and it’s all going down. 
Super noisy. I was awakened on a Sunday morning at 5:30am by my upstairs neighbor taking a shower. The pipes in my bathroom sounded like they were ready to explode. 
It’s affordable - that’s it. It’s too bad because I’ve stayed at lots of other locations and they have been pretty nice.

"The sofa bed in the room did not have a sofa bed mattress but a thin layer of foam.  The area beneath the head of the mattress area was dirty and had rotting food and drink container lids.  The sofa bed sagged and was broken in the middle.  We approached the front desk and asked for assistance to fix the sofa bed and they told us no one is available until the morning so we asked for an alternate room for one night until they could get someone in or a different mattress so our son would have a place to sleep.  The staff told us there was a room available at 4x the original cost we paid for our original room and no other rooms were available.  So we found another hotel that night so our son had a bed to sleep in.  The following morning I spoke to the manager on the phone asking for one night credit (we had three nights booked), and she told me that no one came down to the front desk complaining about a mattress and she called me 30 minutes later telling me the sofa wasn't broken.  I was throughly disappointed by the management of this location.  No one was willing to help us and essentially called us liars about the condition of the sofa bed and wanted to charge us 4x the normally daily rate for one night until they could fix the sofa bed the next day.

"We've stayed at several Choice Hotel properties in the past, with good service and value.  This hotel is not as nice as any of the others in the brand.  
We looked at this hotel prior to our stay and were shown a nice ""renovated"" room.  When reserving on-line, we requested a ""renovated"" room for 2 people.  Got a room with a broken front door handle, with peeling paint, mold in the shower, rusty shower fixtures, stained carpeting, 2 bath towels and 1 set of very small toiletries.  Asked for extra towels and another shampoo/conditioner; was told we had to wait until morning.  Walkway to the room had safety cones placed around broken, unglued floor tiles that moved.  Breakfast items were very sparse; the scrambled eggs weren't real and the sausages looked pretty bad.  Breakfast cabinet doors were padlocked, which really makes a guest worry about safety/theft in the hotel overall.  Our room had no soundproofing; we could hear everything from next door and the hallway.  We were told when checking out, since we were leaving early, we couldn't be checked out or receive the final bill as reservation was made on-line.  And that a general manager had to OK our bill since we booked on-line, and she wasn't in for awhile.  We've traveled for over 30 years in many hotels in the US and overseas; and have never been told we couldn't be checked out of a hotel.  Very disappointing stay.",L2873NEhollym,2017-11-13
"From the start almost to the finish, our stay here was stellar. Diego at the front desk was very welcoming and cordial during checkin. The hotel lobby and breakfast area are quite large, nicely appointed and very inviting. The room was very nice, absolutely spotless, the bed, in fact the entire room and the lobby appear to have been updated recently. The room was very spacious, in fact, large enough for a sleeper sofa that looked like it would make into a second king size bed. 
The room included a small balcony overlooking the street below. 
The flat screen tv was very nice and functioned flawlessly. 
The refrigerator was standard issue for a motel room, or a small apartment! 
We did not have enough time to experience the swimming pool, or a jacuzzi that we spotted on the ground floor. 
The hotel also has an Oriental Restaurant on site, but, alas, we did not have occasion to experience the restaurant. 
The only reason I didn't give this hotel a 5 was breakfast. The omelet was okay, the sausages were good, but the banner ad in the lobby lead me to believe there would be  a hot waffle available.... wrong. They do have a pancake making machine, but it was very disappointing. Each push of button yielded two thin, pancakes smaller than the palm of my hand. The pancakes were rubbery and difficult to cut with the plastic cutlery provided. There were other options, bagles, bread, etc. some fruit, plenty of juice and coffee; but I'm a fan of a well made waffle and really had my tastebuds ready for  a crisp golden brown waffle. Bummer dude!

"My first image impression of this hotel was that it's one of the nicest looking hotel.  When we arrived, our room wasn't even ready.  The bed was not made and I had to call for the maid. However, the office desk was clean and professional looking. I was disappointed in the shower drain.  I pulled out a bunch of long hair, meaning it wasn't removed. Breakfast was ok.  The pop out pancakes on demand was not as good as a typical waffle maker.  The bagel was quite stale.  Not a lot of selection.  The worst part was when my husband was told that he needed to clear out the pool by 10:00 pm. He did not appreciate their poor customer service and advised me to put in his peace of mind on this review. The front desk misinformed me by saying there's no fitness room, but there was one downstairs with a puddle in front.  The spa and bar has been closed.

"Well this,experience has been the example of the WORST customer service I have been put through in my 15 years as a fitness professional who travels the nation teaching large gym chain staffs the importance of customer service and going the extra mile for the member or guest.

It started earlier in the afternoon when the General Manager, Peggy Fleming was RUDE to a fault, put me on hold multiple times for over 5 minutes, hung up on me, didn't answer the phone when I tried calling back for over 30 minutes only to finally answer and put me on hold again. 

I was calling to confirm my reservation I put on my boss's company card and to make sure that I would not need the card or a waiver to use it again for any other charges that were not explained to me because the GM wouldn't talk to me.

When I arrived after driving 3 hours from San Diego where I live the evening receptionist Fadi explained to me that I needed a credit card for a deposit after seeing him tell the previous guests in front of me that he ""could sneak them in and to not tell his manager Penny."" Unfortunately since I didn't know this information, did not have the card on me, and was not allowed to use the card that my boss left on file because it had to be physically there or some sort of waiver signed.

Responsible for managing the Hotel's management team (HOD's) and overall hotel procedures (and here's the best part..) and TARGETS TO DELIVER AN EXCELLENT GUEST EXPERIENCE.

E P I C    F A I L !

I had to call another general manager from another one of my gyms who came down and was able to do that for me which I'm extremely grateful for. When she asked Fadi why he was giving such extremely poor, aggressively degrading, and confrontational customer service that she was receiving from him, he became very angry and started yelling at her saying that he can sneak anybody in he wants, he can do what he wants, if he wants to check people in early he can do that and that's it's none of her business. At this point there was a line behind us and the people were in shock for how he was treating her. I don't know if it was his ethnicity, being Middle Eastern, and how he is used to treating women, but it was extremely degrading and not something I can tolerate.

I mean did I just wake up today in the wrong dimension or something because since when are guests of a hotel, or any type of customer at any business treated in this fashion?

I am the District Manager for one of the largest gym chains in the United States and I've never seen this kind of belligerent, hostile, and combative customer service by anyone that I saw these two representatives of Choice Hotels give me and someone who came to help me for their error in my 15 years of experience in the fitness industry. I am appalled by both these individuals, 

If a customer service or guest relations representative from Choice Hotels or Quality Inn Suites doesn't contact me and explain why I deserved to go through this ordeal and treatment and don't fix it, I will go to the corporate offices of each, or as high as I need to, and I will take this up with them and I will make sure that this review gets put on each hotel search engine site and any other hotel and hospitality site, including social media, and expose this type of treatment to your guests by Penny Fleming and Fadi and shared with thousands.

Unbelievable. Stay away.",Chiali75,2017-09-02
"We got there about 10:55pm on a Saturday evening.
Room seemed clean, except for what it seemed a dead mosquito squashed on a bathroom wall.
Beds were really comfortable

Now for the negative stuff:
- We first had to wait in line to get checked in for about 20 minutes.
- We also noticed a lot of spills on the lobby as well as the dining room area.
- The A/C had a weird noise when it when on during the night. Thankfully, my husband and I wear ear plugs so it wasn’t an issue.
- The breakfast setup is not enough for the large crowd on Sunday morning when we got there around 8:30am:
- No eggs
- Only a few slices of white bread
- No decaf
- No coffee
- No tea
- No fruit
- Somebody made the comment they were there around 7am and there was no food then either

My observations:
- The bacon and egg trays are way too small for the large crowd.
- The attendant was gone for long times to get replenishment.
- By the time she replenished the coffee, left to replenish the bread, the coffee was out again.
- A gallon of milk was left on the attendant’s counter. I think it should have been refrigerated.
- Though she finally replenished the bread tray, there was no wheat bread available.
- Perhaps the replenishment of non-cooked goods could be improved by having the products closer to the attendant: breads, fruit, coffee, etc.
- There should be larger trays of bacon and egg available so the food runs out less often, and have it replaced at determined times even if the tray is not empty. Then we don’t run out of food.
- There should be more coffee dispensers.
- And perhaps for the large Sunday crowd, have 2 attendants.

We were glad we were only staying one night!",amk900,2017-08-14
"Bottom line: comfy, nice accommodations, good breakfast, will go again if the need arrises. 
Shocked by hotel sticker shock in the region, we happened upon this one and decided to book it. At this point we were wanting to get as close to our business mtg. as we could and didn't want to have to make a long drive in the middle of morning rush hour. It was a port in a storm. What was surprising was how nice the staff was, quick check in, but did not like that they wanted to copy my driver's license. Illegal in CA. We declined and explained the law and that they could not do it. Verification is one thing but they can't go beyond that. They gave us a very nice room but it was very hot and it took the a.c. a while to cool it down. The bed was comfy, bathroom was clean and the long counter at the sink was very nice for getting organised. The room was clean and comfy. Breakfast was very good. The pancakes were tasty. The morning desk guy would not let me get my paperwork until the time of actual check out. First time I ever experienced that. Not a big deal, but would have preferred to get a copy of the paperwork, load up the car, and drop off the key. It's not that important and we were pleased with the good service and accommodations as mentioned. Will go back for sure in the future.",johntrak,2017-07-22
"When I checked into my room there was a small but adequate desk.  There was no chair to use at the desk.  I guess you did not intend for the desk to be used, because there was no bulb in the desk lamp.  That is really unacceptable.  The room was not ready for guests.  Somebody doesn't care.  I got the chair and the light bulb, but I should not have had to ask.

Next, what's up with only 15 channels on the TV?  I have the cheapest plan at home and have 3 times as many channels.  No cable here?  No movie channels?  No kid friendly channels?  Pretty lame!
I have stayed here a few times, but not again, given the choice of other hotels near here",stu3art,2017-07-11
"We had a bad experience at another hotel and got to this hotel and got into our online room booked quickly. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. This is not the fanciest hotel but in a good location for food choices and fun. The breakfast is simple with eggs and sausage or bacon in the warmer, pancake maker, toast, bagels, donuts or muffins depending on the day, yogurt, fruit or cereal options. We were satisfied with our stay. ",366sierrat,2017-07-08
"Checked in late evening. Easy to find. Lots of food choices around and there's a Chinese restaurant attached. Free wifi, free parking, free breakfast, free friendly staff. I think I was helped by Penny. The nice lady friend Sydney Australia. At first my key didn't work. I tried a few times then she escorted me to my room to make sure I got in. Awesome customer service. There's a pool to cool off in this summer heat. Opened the door and wow was I surprised. I was expecting low budget sketchy room with things broken down.  Not at all. It's a lot better then a lot of other hotel rooms I've stayed at. Reminds me of a casino hotel room. Marble bathroom countertops, a sofa, large fridge with freezer. Nice wide table with comfy office chair. Nice lighting and aircon. Coffee with green recycle cups. Way to go! Ice bucket with toiletries. Clean wide bed and flat screen. I wish I was staying longer so I can enjoy my room longer. Totally staying here again. It's perfect.  There's a Mc. Donald's just yards away right by the pool. Scored an awesome suite",Jetset18MelM,2017-07-08
"As a business owner this was the most horrible customer service in the world and I have spent the last 33 days traveling the world over 12+ hotels stayed at and this one was the absolutely the worse, I will never come back our recommend this hotel to anyone.",rudyv745,2017-07-03
"I am a local of the area and stayed here over night. The property itself is very old and has been here for many many years. The rooms were not as bad as I thought though as I entered mine. There were a few things in the room that needed fixing or attention, but other than that the room was fine. The front desk employee was very fast and had great customer service. This was the cheaper option out of all the hotels in the area that is why I chose to stay here. In conclusion, I recommend staying here for a short amount of time because of its location to the freeway and the room was clean enough to live with.",Solstice63,2017-06-06
"Clean room & bathroom. Ok pool area. Lots of parking. Noisy AC, loud sounds coming from the walls no idea what they were every time it was turned on. Good phone service. The hotel is being renovated but no inconveniences. Wifi works great. Decent size room. Weird cable channels, fuzzy did not come in clear. Very quiet stay. Good bedding. Complimentary breakfast is ok. Very helpful staff always a plus. ",marzj2017,2017-05-06
"We have stayed in many, MANY hotels and this has to come down as one of the worst.  From the management (Peggy) to housekeeping you feel like you are more in a sanitarium than a hotel.  The rooms are terrible and the breakfast is a 2 at the most. They were mostly proud of their pancake maker. Yes, pancake maker.  You poor in the syrup and it comes out as a pancake... sometimes.  They are great to play frisbee with!",tomcarterprod2016,2017-04-28
"I was OK with the missing toilet paper, lack of towels and even the top sheet for the bed. What did it for me was the stairwell that smelled so highly of urine that I I was about to throw up. I understand when u have to go but this was numerous occasions that it had been used as a toilet. Maybe a port o potty for the workers doing the renovation would help. Breakfast was good. Housekeeping was bothersome at 9am while myself and the boyfriend were getting busy. All in all-stay away from the stairwells.",873shawnad,2017-04-11
"This is a larger Quality Inn that works well when staying in the area.

The place is older and is getting some upgrades.  Overall, it's a fine place to stay when visiting the area.

The breakfast is good and includes eggs, pancakes, yogurt, breads, cereals, etc.  One day there were scrambled eggs and sausage and the other days there were fried eggs -- cooked 'till the yolks were hard -- and sausage.  The scrambled eggs were better.

The breakfast space is large, so there are enough tables for visitors -- something not all hotels have!

The place appears to have had a second building added, so there are ramps on each floor -- inside -- to connect them.

Finding stairs is tricky -- they aren't where you'd expect them, so look for the Exit signs.

The Olive Chinese Restaurant, inside the hotel, is a funny one for a hotel, but the food is good and the price is right!

Overall, a good choice for a place to stay in the area.",MikeVdP,2017-04-08
"Friendly staff and comfy beds. During my stay the hotel was going through some renovations. That didn't impact my stay though. My room was clean and roomy. The bed was very comfortable. I had a nice little balcony that caught the sun just right. There was a Continental breakfast included which had eggs, sausage, pancakes, toast, bagels, yogurt, juice, coffee, cereal, and oatmeal. Nearby there is a starbucks, Buffalo wild wings, McDonald's, and pizza studio and few more restaurant's within walking distance.",Y8345WMmarting,2017-03-16
"In 2016 we stayed at this hotel for one month. The friendly efficient service we received from Lynda is the reason for us returning for Jan, Feb and March 2017. Jim, at the front desk checked us in, when we first arrived, in a friendly and efficient manner and we have relied on him, at our request, to renew our booking each month. D, our breakfast waitress, is quick and always has a smile. Our room is pleasant and always kept very clean with a comfortable bed and a good sitting area. Any small maintenance problem is quickly taken care of. Location is good for shopping, entertainment and beach.",D3180OCroys,2017-03-14
"This is  a very nice Hotel located in great area on Hotel row. Very different from most Quality Inn. I stayed for several days, and since I had to modify my original reservation, they had to move me - and room downstairs was even better. Rooms are very very clean. Has Interior corridors. Just make sure you go have your breakfast by 9, since they immediately take everything out. I had issue, but it was resolved. There was Chinese restaurant I had dinner, and it was so so, and overpriced - wouldn't recommended.",OLSENN_13,2017-01-18
I came in late and left early so I didn't try the wireless. The front desk staff was helpful and efficient. My room was clean and exactly what I wanted in space. I didn't eat breakfast so I can't comment on it.,M4168WPkevinh,2016-12-15
"Professional Hospitality

What we look for in places we stay are professionals that know what hospitality is all about and this Quality Inn location does.

When it comes to hospitality and service this place gets a ""10"". The rooms are newly remodeled with new furniture, beds, paint and carpeting. My room was great!

I have been luck to have FADI as my host at check-in. His service is excellent and makes check-in a breeze!

This place is centrally located in Orange County with easy access to freeways. If you're in the area check them out...",TravelXer,2016-11-17
"The hotel is being renovated and I was told that I would be given a NEWLY renovated room.  The freezer section of the frig was frozen, the room smelled fresh, the linens were fresh but the sofa was recovered in a scary red shiney poka dot material.  Don't think I would sit on it.  I moved the sofa slightly away from the bed and the floor was dirty.....maybe in time things will very better. ",Nonna4308,2016-10-02
"The location was convenient and there were restaurants within walking distance...BUT the rooms were DATED. The wallpaper was peeling in the halls and paint was chipped. They had a sign saying ""renovating"" but we saw no one doing any such thing. Our balcony door didn't open, the bathroom sink didn't match up to the faucet and the water just went all over the counter, and there was a crowd of younger people staying across from us and seemed to be indulging in a hot box session of the green kind if you know what I mean. When I told the desk, he chuckled. Traveling with kids and having marijauna present did not sound remotely funny to me. We stayed for 2 nights for a sports tournament and the side entry/exit had a filthy busser's tray full of dirty dishes and trash next to it the entire time. No one moved it, no one cleaned it. I love to travel and most of the time am not looking for posh accommodations by any means, but this was subpar at very best and we will not be staying here again.",happyhumble5,2016-09-14
"Currently under renovation, Quality Inn & Suites still boasts a nice lobby, ample dining room space and also an on-site Chinese restaurant.

Sadly, our view was marred by a dumpster and construction detritus, but the customer service exhibited by Fadi & Jim was exemplary.

Thank you for a very enjoyable two-day stay.",Lobsterollsforever,2016-09-05
"We arrived early and went to see if we could check in early.   The manager on duty (Peggy) told us to sit down, she'd have an answer in 15 minutes.  After about 10 minutes we asked her again and she told us very rudely that nothing was available, and to come back later. I was not happy with her poor attitude.   When we did check in, hours later, a very nice gentleman checked us in. We told him of our previous experience with Peggy,  he told us that he knew but couldn't say anything. 
The room was very clean, the hotel is going through a remodel but we didn't notice any construction.  Breakfast offered free was decent but not fancy.  Overall hotel was ok but that manager need to learn what working in hospitality service means.",E5890GIlindas,2016-08-31
"My wife and I stayed one night in a room on the third floor.  Nearby are I-5 highway and Lake Forest blvd...which together creates road noise that is heard at night.  A/C is a separate unit that is wall mounted.  The air flow from it is noticeable when on the bed nearest it.  Beds were comfortable and bathroom is typical of a low/mid range hotel.  Compared to prices of nearby hotels it is quite reasonable.  Staff were nice.
There is a breakfast provided with room.  It has a large seating area and has usual items, but instead of a waffle maker it has a pancake making machine that is automatic. Press a button and the batter is poured and the pancake is cooked. The pancake is small and thin.  I tried one and found it bland and a little ""rubbery"".  The bacon is cooked and in a tray that had a lot of liquid fat at the bottom and when I picked up a bacon piece it dripped fat.  Not my type of bacon.
If I stayed again at the hotel it would only be because of the price.",travelnice,2016-08-30
"I had an enjoyable experience during my stay. The room was clean and comfortable, the general manager Penny answered all of my questions and provided excellent customer service, and the breakfast was great. The next time I plan on visiting I will definitely book my stay again with the Quality Inn.",152aishaw,2016-08-17
"I had written a review when the Quality Inn asked me how my stay was at the Quality Inn. I explained all of the issues I had in the review. Immediately the next day, the general manager Penny called me to discuss my experience and I told her the Interest was fast, the beds were out of this world but when I checked in the room I was assigned to the room had not been cleaned yet. And I was given the wrong room key type. Also, we had breakfast close to the end of the time it was open and the variety of food was less. Penny jumped into action, she explained they were booked up the night before and the cleaning staff work over time to get the rooms done and the key system was having a change over. The beauty of Penny is, she explained why the problems occurred and did not make excuses. The breakfast piece she would work with her staff on. Penny took care of the problem immediately making me a happy customer, and I would definitely return again. It was just the circumstances. Penny ""THANK YOU"" for having us as a guest and for taking care of the situation without argument!!",norifrasier,2016-08-13
"This hotel was very clean. The beds were comfortable which matters to my husband.
Inside hall to the rooms made us feel safe. The breakfast was nice but I missed the waffles. They had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and continental foods. The rooms were a nice side. The bathroom had been updated with granite countertop.",seenmanyplaces,2016-08-12
My wife and I stayed 2 nights and had a wonderful experience. The staff was very friendly and the manager Penny provided great customer service at the front desk. I would 100% recommend this hotel and whenever we are visiting family we will be staying here. Thank you Penny and the Quality Inn & Suites staff you were all amazing!!!,jakekosh26,2016-08-09
"My friend and I checked in with our two teenagers at 9 pm on a Saturday night in July. Fortunately, we had a reservation because the hotel was packed, but we had no problem finding convenient parking near the entrance.  When my friend went down to the lobby for more towels, the lobby desk clerk brought them up a few minutes later.  Our room was on the 3rd floor, on the side of the hotel facing the street, but surprisingly quiet.  The beds were comfortably firm with fluffy pillows and a cozy, lightweight comforter.
     I was impressed by the Olive Tree restaurant located inside the hotel.   Arriving at 9:10, after the official closing time, we were surprised to be welcomed in.  I was expecting a ""cookie cutter"" Chinese restaurant, but instead discovered a unique place run by a proud, skilled cook and his wife.  The pad Thai on the menu was authentic, and the orange chicken was declared by one of the picky eater teenagers to be ""the best I've ever had.""
      The next morning, having stayed at plenty of hotels with only a few tables in the breakfast area, I was happy to discover plenty of space to sit.  However, with the hotel completely full, it was impossible for the one man working the area to keep everything stocked.  The buffet officially closed at 9:30, and by 8:45, almost all of the fruit, and all the scrambled eggs and sausage were gone.  However, if you had time to wait a while and willingness to ask, the attendant would get you what you needed.  After 9:30, as he worked putting away breakfast supplies and cleaning tables, he was very friendly and helpful with some questions about things to do in the area.
     One last perk of this hotel was the small balcony off the room.  In Southern California, it's great to enjoy the night air on a balcony!
     P.S.  In the lobby, look up!  There's a cool chandelier.",teacherkaren2016,2016-07-27
"Stayed one night while attending a concert at Irvine Meadows. Two miles from venue, easy to Uber to and from. Honestly, I had read the bad reviews and took a chance. It maybe in the midst of renovation, but our room, above lobby, was quiet, very clean, and the air worked great as well as everything else in the room. The bed was one of the best mattresses I have slept on, even compared to some higher end hotels. Breakfast was your basic type, bujt hey, it is included. WiFi was actually suprisongly fast and I will go back there again. Look, for the price you pay for a room, it is better than most. It is a smiple yet functionable room, and even has a balcony. Conviently located, able to waalk to whatever you need.",ballerina501,2016-07-25
"I stayed at the Quality Inn and it is in need of an overhaul. I had a suite, which was large and quiet but the rooms are very rundown. My room had ants in the bathtub and sink. It had a dingy smell and was very old and outdated. There are a lot of families there and a Starbucks nearby. For business travelers it is not good.",938sarad,2016-07-21
"After finding out that I had made a reservation at the wrong location, and would be stuck with the charges, I appealed to the general manager, and am so relieved that she agreed to reimburse the charges, which she did not have to do. Thank you so much Penny! ",sunbeauty11,2016-07-20
"Very friendly service. The hotel is under major renovation and we where given a newer room. Reasonable price considering the location... 

I would stay again When I'm in the area.  This hotel is centrally located in Orange County and is about 15 minutes from the beach or Disneyland. It's easy to find just off of the 5 freeway. 

",TravelXer,2016-07-08
We really enjoyed our stay here. It has a beautiful lobby to begin with! Our room was nice and clean. We brought our little dog and they were very welcoming. We had a little trouble having to wait to check in because the computer system was down butt that was not their fault.  Nice hot water!  There were signs saying they were renovating but we never saw signs of it. Beautiful pool too!,brighteyesWisconsin,2016-07-02
"Upon arrival the general manager resolved a billing issue in my favor which I later realized was entirely my fault! Fadi at front desk was courteous, friendly and super helpful - professional. The room was clean. Bathroom spotless and updated. Nice decor. Bed was oh so comfortable. Free parking, wi-fi, breakfast (delicious). I will stay again.",maureend394,2016-05-07
Without going into allot of detail. Manager was courteous and diligent in addressing my concerns.  She accommodated me respectfully and assured my comfort.  Food is within walking distance the property has an Asian Restaurant located in the building that delivers at minimal cost.  This was very convenient.   I will definitely return for business or pleasure.,YCF5,2016-03-30
"Free parking, decent rates, with free breakfast and (super crappy) free Wi-Fi.

I had a three day stay. On day two, the workers replaced all the beds in the hotel with new ones, not mine of course, because I was already checked in. So, needless to say, so-so bed at best. The pillows are HORRIBLE! I woke every morning sore from the bunchy, well worn, and deflated pillows. 

As stated in previous reviews, no hot water (and once it does come in, it is DANGEROUSLY hot. Parents beware! My son was screaming and quite red, and he is no wimp.)

The room badly needed a face lift, as the 1985-esque wallpaper was peeling profusely. And the carpet had sticky un-identifiable substances in a few places.

Breakfast: Decent, no complaints 

Service: Wonderful, outside of the douchy morning guy with a contemptuous attitude and the fact that they ration your towels like you're in a nut house and plan to use them for escape. There was 5 of us in a 2 bed suite and we received 3 towels..ok, and receiving more took a minimum of an hour each time, 'cause yeah..that works with kids. ( We attempted to get in advance, and went directly to front desk, and both times towels were unavailable.)

Would only stay again if on a budget, traveling alone, in a jacuzzi suite. Best Western next door is in same price range so maybe I will give them a whirl. ..",cristinas554,2016-03-18
"Parking: Free lot with plenty of spaces.

Staff:  Very friendly and helpful.

Location:  Off the 5 freeway and easy to find.  Lots of things nearby, McDonald's is literally next door and so is a Shell gas station.  But plenty of other eateries and shopping nearby.

Hotel:  Beds are so so, rooms are adequate.  In terms of budget, this hotel fits your needs.  One comment about the TV, basic cable with no HBO or Showtime.  

Wifi:  Free but slow, I would have rather paid for WiFi.

Breakfast:  Not bad at all with pancakes, coffee, bagels, and yogurts.

Overall:  3/5 stars, average hotel that will fit your budget needs.",lionel86,2016-02-25
Was very close to the business I had to do while in town. The restaurant inside had some great food. Did not have any transportation so I can't tell what was nearby. Staff was very friendly and helpful to get me to where I needed to be when checking out.  Was pretty quiet slept OK ,46edwardj,2016-02-17
"We booked last minute needing somewhere for the night on a business trip. Good location right off the freeway. We arrived late and got right in. 

The room is okay. The bathroom had somewhat been renovated leaving old with new. I had left my purse on the dresser and in the morning picked it up and it was filled with bugs. Promptly threw it away. We will spend a few more dollars for the hotel next door.",Acefalo,2016-02-14
"Nice area, felt safe...would stay at this hotel again.  Central location for where we needed to be.   Breakfast was good and low cost on the rooms.  Didn't enjoy pool (little cold outside) or hot tub this trip..... but this hotel worked for us.",denisebG8266PU,2016-01-25
"Our stay at Quality Inn & Suites Irvine Spectrum in Lake Forest, California was a great memorable one. The rooms were clean, good and neat. The breakfast was delicious. The staff at the reception were so friendly.",prakashpathi,2015-12-31
"I needed a place for a quick in-out one night stay.  My class was nearby and started earlier than I could arrive by air, so the only choice was to fly down the night before.  I did a search on TripAdvisor for places nearby and the Quality Inn popped up.  I have stayed at Quality Inns before, and while not luxurious, the do have free wifi and free breakfast.  On occasion, I have run into hotels that don't start the breakfast until 7 or 7:30, later than I can deal with.  This hotel started at 6:30 so it worked well.  Food wasn't gourmet, but quite acceptable and it is nice that they have take-away cups for the coffee for the ride to the class.",Halems,2015-12-04
"Like my namesake, Jonathan H reviewed, this hotel is clean and cheap and sometimes that's all you need.  We just cleared out a house that we sold so we were tired, it was raining, and the Quality Inn was in front of us.  The rooms are large enough and definitely clean.   We originally were only going to stay for two days but ended up adding two more as the hotel was so convenient to the freeway and surrounding restaurants.  Olive Tree Chinese Kitchen inside the hotel is a diamond in the rough---fabulous food that is not salty or smothered in goopy sauces.  Dumplings rivaled China town.  Breakfast at the hotel was fine with full-sized yogurts, eggs, sausages, and good coffee.  Service is very good.",jsh35715,2015-11-07
"If you look up the definition of a 2-star hotel, you might find a picture of this Quality Inn in Irvine. It certainly meets all the criteria: It's outdated but serviceable, and you probably wouldn't want to stay more than one night.

Among the negatives: A sliding glass door to the balcony that wouldn't lock, awful WiFi speed, and zero hot water in the shower. The room is in desperate need of an upgrade, and the TV remote didn't work. But if your expectations are low before you arrive, it's fine. The front desk cashier was friendly and they had a decent free breakfast in the morning. The hotel is located next to a McDonalds, and there's a Starbucks/gas station just two minutes away. It's also close to the freeway. 

As long as you're not expecting anything more than 2 stars, this property will do. We were only there for a total of about 10 hours, and that was more than enough.",56waldorf,2015-10-25
The Quality Inn is a budget hotel for people looking for a cheap place to stay....the have free wifi and a free fill your tummy continental breakfast which is a better option than buy breakfast at McDonald's next door.  There's a pool and a cheap Chinese restaurant in the lobby.  Its actually a decent deal for what you pay,jonathanh385,2015-10-06
"If you are on a budget it will be okay but I wouldn't stay too long. Here are some of the issues that may be a concern to you. First the lobby and hall ways are not air conditioned making hot days in these areas unbearable. This might make the staff cranky as well... 

Second the keys to the room did not function well requiring several trips to the front desk a hassle. While making several trips you'll notice the elevators are extremely slow and blazing hot when you are in them.... 

Free breakfast was not as good as other hotels as well. My recommendation if not a a strict budget try some place else in the area....",286RickM,2015-09-10
"This hotel was ok for our purposes. it was a place to shower and sleep. We did not intend to make it a resort stay.  It was really convenient to the freeway, shopping, and the place we were going each day. The hotel needs refurbishing. Everything was worn, but clean, except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor after the maid had been there each day. It wasn't that the staff was unfriendly, they were just indifferent. Breakfast was mediocre at best. With all the hotels in the area, we probably wouldn't stay here again.",moses72548,2015-09-01
"I was traveling with a very budget conscious group for a conference in the area.  The hotel was fine, but worn. It definitely needs a cosmetic updates.  Some of the King bed rooms on the interior hall of the 3rd floor of the front building have cool vaulted ceilings so they seemed more spacious.  The outer rooms are just plain and small.  The beds/bath were clean, but there were some cigarette burns on the comforters and weird stains on the wall.  The area looks a little dodgy, but is near some decent neighborhoods.  We also think that the gas from our van may have been siphoned/stolen one night. It is hard to find good deals in Southern California so this place works if your money is tight.",SuzB0203,2015-08-28
"Staff not very friendly, Room was too hot when I arrived, by the time it cooled down enough to sleep it was 3:30 am and I had to get up at 5:30 am, the web site they said they offer a free shuttle within a 5 mile radius and when I asked they said we don't do that.Had I known this I would not have booked here. I don't think I would booking here again when I come to Cali again.",700robinm,2015-08-26
"This is a decent hotel, right off the freeway, so it's easy to find. Traffic is horrendous, but depending on time of day, it's a pretty short drive to Laguna Beach and some shopping centers. There is not much in the neighborhood of the hotel. Nothing in walking distance, except a Mcdonalds next door. The hotel is clean, and the rooms were nice and pretty quiet. They have complimentary breakfast, with hot foods and cold. ",Lotitravel,2015-08-02
Near freeway and not too far from Irvine.  Rooms are dated and front desk staff was generally polite but not great.  The breakfast was adequate and the lobby was relatively clean though not used to seeing so much fake greenery and flowers everywhere.  We did not use the pool and I hardly saw the restaurant open though we were gone most of the time.  Lots of families and a good value for the area.,NomadicSandra,2015-07-26
"Right off the freeway, easy to find.
Hotel needs a remodel. Rooms are dated but functional. Beds are ok. Shower is good. Pool is nice, outdoor.
Staff need a training in customer service. Looks and acts like they don't want to be there. Not very focused on customer service.
Free computer and printer access.
Parking is free.
Chinese restaurant at hotel, nice staff and food is fair.
AC unit is loud in the rooms.
Breakfast is basic, fruit, bagels, waffles eggs...
Would look at other options for next trip.",MAUREENH47,2015-07-16
"I really like this place when I need to visit my Kids. It is a very nice location

"As a Travel Agent/Owner of CruiseOne - Erik Fischer & Associates I would have to say this is on my top 5 of worst properties I have ever stayed at. Upon arrival in the early afternoon the employee (unknown when we drove up) was smoking and looked agitated when he put it out and walked inside behind the desk. They gave me a smaller room than requested. When I questioned him about this he was fairly argumentative and said I booked it online. I advised I called because they had the same picture for all the suites and I particularly wanted a 1 bedroom. Instead he put us in a junior suite and stated thats all they had. He then went on to tell me I was lucky he was checking me in before 3:00 pm as that is when check in time is. I told him I gave never had an issue with checking in early at other hotels and he argued with me no other hotel does it either. I asked if he wanted me to name who does and he said yes. It was like he was calling me a liar. Turns out he was the General Manager of this property and his name was Darren Yang. 

Room as as far back as you could get on the property. Upon entering I got hit with a extremely strong oder of mildew/mold. It was strong everywhere. The comforter really smelled of mildew. My nose instantly clogged up. When I went to call the phone did not work. I then found ants all over the bath tub. They were coming and going from the water valve and the overflow drain and I was on the third floor. 

I chose not to eat there as this hotel was a train wreck. Management was so very unprofessional and room was horrible. I told him what I did professionally and I would be reviewing his property but he did not care.

Bottom line.... stay clear of this property unless you don't care about the things I mentioned. I have stayed at all types of properties for my job from 5 star resorts to 1 star small family run properties and this is most definitely on my top 5 of worst which is disappointing as it is in a great location. It just needs new management and to be shut down for a renovation and fumigation.

Again, I will never return and I recommend the same to you.",CAP679915,2015-07-05
"In short, the best value I've found when work takes me to Orange County. 
This hotel is a border-line 2.5 star/3 star. It does have a restaurant (banker hours though so I've never been), but it does offer a free HOT breakfast that I've always enjoyed (especially their eggs and sausage).
There rates have been the best I can find for a 2.5 or 3 star hotel, and the 24-hour front desk has proven to be helpful more than just once.
I also really appreciate that most rooms at this hotel are not only spacious and equipped with microwaves, mini fridges, and flat screen TV's, but also come with private balconies.

"I booked 6 rooms for my soccer team and their families because we were participating in a tournament in Mission Viejo. The location was excellent due to it being a short drive to Oso Complex. Each party had a minimum of 2 parents plus 1 teenager and we checked in Saturday evening around 5pm. Check in was great and no one had any issues. We also had one party that checked in at midnight with no issues to report. First, yes this is an older hotel but honestly if you want a ""new"" hotel you have to pay the price for that quality. We wanted convenience and  financially friendly. The rooms were fine and ALL parties said they were very pleased with their rooms. One negative, the AC was not kicking our freezing cold air even when the temp was adjusted to 60 degrees, but it was cold. Rooms were clean, showers worked fine, and the beds were comfortable. Positive, if you have kids the rooms have two Queen beds, not doubles, which was awesome for my two kids to sleep on. Pool area and spa was great. We used the washer/dryer to clean uniforms and detergent/coins could be purchased at front desk. Detergent was $2, wash cost $2, dry cost $2. All families took advantage of the free breakfast which was great. Everyone was pleased with the food. If your not a fan of the food their is a McDonalds in the parking lot. I liked the free breakfast! There is a chinese restaurant inside the hotel but we did not eat there. 
Only negative, not the hotel, is that people who stay can smoke. I don't smoke cigarettes and those who do usually have the smoke stay on their clothes and on any material they come in contact with. A guest was smoking on the balcony and I am sure the room will smell like smoke. Other than that everything was great and i would stay here again with my family for a short 1-2 stay. If looking for romantic getaway, this is not your spot. I recommend for short stay with kids/teens.",F9684ELpaulm,2015-06-08
"This is an old building that has been reasonably maintained, but shows it's age in some common areas like the garage, stairwells and pool area. I would have given this just an ""okay"" review, but for the 4 days I stayed there was always a problem with the hot water in my third floor room.  On two mornings there was none at all until I complained at the front desk and they said they had just ""reset"" the boiler. I had to wait a half hour an then the water was only tepid and barely warm enough to take a shower. On the third day the said the boiler had been ""fixed"" but in the next morning it was back to ""barely warm enough"" water.  In the afternoon and evening the water was properly hot so I decided to bathe before bed to ensure I had some. The room I had overlooked the pool located in the central courtyard, and it can be quite noisy with a group of people there.  On one night a large noisy group of teens decided to have a pool party until closing time, and I couldn't get to sleep for the noise even with the window closed.",585matthewh,2015-06-03
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel recently when attending a concert at the Verizon Ampitheater (now Irvine Meadows).  The first impression is that this is a very nice place as the lobby area is beautiful.  However, once we got into our room it was apparent that this is an older hotel that has had some cosmetic improvements but is still in need of a major overhaul and maintenance.  The drain stoppers in both the bathroom sink and tub were broken.  We also found a dirty t-shirt left on the floor from a previous occupant so the cleaning staff is questionable as far as their attention to duty.  They have a restaurant at this hotel which was ok.  (Chinese food)  The desk staff was also very slow and they didn't seem to know what they were doing.  I can't recommend this hotel as I am sure there are better places to stay in the area.",stevencH4861VJ,2015-05-27
"I picked this hotel because of its close proximity to the Irvine Amphitheater and the fact that they had shuttle service.  I booked ahead as the weekend was a surprise birthday present for my wife.  I called two days before to confirm everything and was informed they no longer did any shuttle service.  Alright, we'll work around the inconvenience.  Upon arrival, I was greeted with a big smile by Maj.  This, of course, was after she finished her texting.  Later I visited the front desk with a question, and again waited while the texting continued.  The next day at checkout, I was surprised to see Maj again with front-desk duty, with the obligatory wait while texts are completed.  Other than that, our visit was pleasant but too brief.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The TV was large but with only local and standard channels.  I would consider staying here again.  I would have given four stars, but having my own business, it was irritating to see someone who was hired to do a job playing on her phone.",travelforfunnstuff,2015-05-24
"For the price paid (~$100) and compared to other similarly priced hotels in the area, this hotel was bad. Its a slight step up from Motel 6, but below comparable budget chain hotels. 

First of all, the hotel is named  ""Quality Inn & Suites Irvine Spectrum"". This hotel is 3 miles from the Irvine Spectrum and the neighborhood is a big drop down from Irvine. 

Second, the rooms were really old. The room smells like cigarettes (even though the rooms were non smoking) and was really dark and poorly lit. The furniture was old, the carpet stained and had holes, and the curtains didn't work well so it was hard to get light in. Plus, it was really noisy from the freeway (even though I didn't face the freeway (Room 303) even with the sliding door closed.

Third, the free breakfast was not good. Juice was water like, eggs tasted like it was powdered, and rolls from $1 stores. Granted it was Free, but for a couple of bucks the McDonalds next door breakfast is a lot better. 

Fourth, I had a dispute with the front desk and corporate office regarding their Choice Privileges Hotel Reward Program. Rather than being a little accommodating and understanding, they were incompletely inflexible.

Overall, I will never stay here (or likely another Choice property (due to the dispute)) again as I believe there are better options for similar value elsewhere where my business is appreciated.",ewoo72,2015-03-27
"The area the hotel is located in is not great. Check in was fairly quick and i took the old elevator to the second floor.
Upon entering my room I got a smell of Damp and the room was dark and poorly lit. The room was very dated , but it was pretty much what i expected for the price, one of the cheapest hotels in the area.",497jaydal,2015-03-17
I have to admit it... I am a high maintenance Hotel customer. I like to stay at nicer places because they make me feel like I'm somebody important.

These are great employees and are excellent at customer service.,damonb533,2015-03-05
"When I arrived I was greeted by a sign in the counter saying someone will be back in five minutes, should have said ten.  My credit card imprint for incidentals was taken on an old imprinter on a piece of paper which now sits who knows where?  I had to walk through a wall of water pouring through the ceiling on the second floor walkway.  Literally a wall of water.  As I walked into the room there was a musty smell and many cosmetic flaws (wallpaper peeling) and possible water damage that was poorly repaired. Soffit above sink was only about 6 feet tall causing many head bumps. Bathroom was poorly lit and there was some mold on the ceiling in the shower.  There was no attention to detail anywhere.  All spaces were dated and needed updating.  Stairways weren't marked well I had to look at map in room to find their locations.  When i did use them they were dirty and were clumsily repaired including screws used to Hold down the plastic traction coverings.  Tripping hazard?  I booked this online.  Maybe they give the online bookings unremodeled rooms?  Pool had debris on the bottom. I won't ever stay here again.  Staff could use hospitality training also. Not friendly not hostile either just didn't seem professional or outgoing. Fridge and micro were stacked several feet from desk and looked out of place. Two lights weren't plugged in and the clock was not set even close to the correct time.  No attention to details.

"Was retreiving my Ford, at a nearby dealership. And took the train from the IE,. the afternoon before. I Thought:' ""how conveinient and well planned"",. It Was. I chose a room on the 3rd floor, which offered a Huge-pitched ceiling. I requested a nice view. I got: a view of an empty parking lot, and bustling commerce on the adjacent I-5 freeway. There was a balcony as well. Couch. Work Area. Good A/C. Big acceptable bed. In Room Coffee. But Nasty' Included' morning breakfast. Those Eggs? Oily? with crusty stuff around the edge. Not tantalizing. ust standard oily bacon. The Attitude and display of this AM breakfast, felt more like an Instutution. and Something from eastern europe?

"My family and I were attending an event about 10 minutes away and this was the cheapest hotel in the area. It is right off the freeway which made it easy. Even though there is a parking garage, the lot fills up at night. Check in was easy enough. The breakfast was good, waffles, bagels, pastries, oatmeal, fruit. Make sure you get there early because it was busy and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a waffle. The room itself was clean, the bed was comfortable, but the carpet needs to be replaced. The bathroom needs an upgrade. There were broken tiles, faucet was falling apart, and the hairdryer made weird noises and didn't dry that well.  The staff was friendly. If you need to crash in the area, why not?",MrsBrandt,2014-09-05
Me and my boyfriend only stayed for one night while we were visiting Laguna Beach for a small budgeted getaway. However we had a very nice stay for a decent price. We checked in late at night and the front desk was exceptional. This hotel was clean and I would stay again.,GraceIshak,2014-08-11
"This motel is average at best. It's off of the 5 Freeway on Rockfield in a business park next to a McDonald's. If you see the McDonald's turn there! Otherwise you might bypass the motel. There are other ways of accessing this place, but this is the easiest. The neighborhood houses mid-scale types of restaurants and shops. Nothing fancy. Nothing real good. The mall down the road has seen better days. My room overlooked the pool. On stuffy days (which I had while I was there) the chlorine suspended in the air. So I closed the balcony door and turned on the air conditioner. The pool, though, is actually useful and there is a small exercise area. When I was there youth baseball players were using the facilities. The lobby is large, there's a guest computer useful for replacing the ""iffy"" Wi-Fi, and there's also an on-site Chinese restaurant. The continental breakfast is free but, if there is a large group staying there, try to eat early so you still have some good food choices left. My room had a fridge and microwave. Good for storing some drinks, groceries, and cookies. But I didn't like the bed pillows. They were shaped like rectangles and too firm. The motel is an easy drive down to the beachfront at Laguna. But you'll need to get an early start for free parking. Otherwise, you can feed the meters or park in the pay lots. Laguna does provide shuttle service. Free in the summer, a small fee other times. But I parked at the Laguna Hills Mall, hailed the 89 bus, paid a small fare and, 25 minutes later, was dropped 4 blocks from the sand. If you do this, check the schedule for the return because the evening buses run but once an hour.",Zoom_Gotti,2014-08-01
"This was the worst hotel experience for our money we have ever had. We paid $159/night and this hotel is more in value compared to a Motel 6, pretending to be something better. We reserved a non-smoking room, which wreaked of smoke. A dirty towel was left on the floor. A bed skirt was splattered with who knows what. The decor and decorations are cheap and thrown together. No coffee packets were provided in the room. When we did get them, we found out the coffee maker did not work properly, had coffee all over the place. The sliding door lock was broken, only the bar to keep it secure. Pool edge was about 5 feet from our room, extremely noisy, room 142. TV was not plugged in, but figured that out eventually. Someone elses hairs were in the sink upon arrival. Witnessed a server snap at a guest at breakfast, for no apparent reason, other than she was overworked and frustrated. Only one server was not enough for the amount of people trying to get breakfast. Coffee out, pastries out, forks gone, regular waffle mix out. Sand or some odd substance inside the entry to the outside. Halls/stairwells to outside were filthy. Carpets in the room made you feel dirty. Room door would not close unless you pulled it closed. This hotel is outdated and in need of major upgrades and deep down cleaning, as well as better management of housekeeping and maintenance.
It was a place to sleep, nothing more, and we won't be back.",Angie423,2014-07-29

"I booked a five night stay. When I returned to the room it was cleaned but all the blankets were thrown on the sofa. I tried to call but the phone didn’t work. I called the hotel from my Cell and spoke to Jim. I told him that I was in room 231 and the phone didn’t work. He responded with a smart answer that I needed to push a button to get a dial tone, which I tried and pushed line one and line two. Then I explained my issue with the blankets. Again a smart answer - that means they should be back in maybe 10 minutes to make the bed. Twenty minutes later I called the toll free number but was told I couldn’t file a complaint until I checked out. So I  checked out early and booked with Best Western located behind thier location. Basically this location didn’t have enough sheets for the rooms occupied. I been a customer for a while but this is the last time I will stay at a Choice Hotel. By the Wat Best Wester Spectrum is Awesome !!!",NicoVas1,2014-06-17
"I went to Orange County for a sporting event from 6/5 to 6/9/2014 and got a great deal on this Hotel through priceline. My expectations were not too high considering the relatively low star rating and some critical reviews. I have to say that the Hotel exceeded all my expectations in any way.. I got there at 2:30, 30 minutes prior to their 3 PM check in time and the friendly young lady at the front desk were able to get me into a room after checking with the cleaning staff. The lobby looked very clean.. The front doors looked a little dated and could use a fresh coat of paint and the AC vents in the lobby showed a little bit of age, but other than that, the impression was flawless.. When I got to the room, I was pleasantly surprised.. The room was good size with a small balcony. The room appeared remodeled with upgraded bathroom and newer looking furniture. Bed was comfortable for me as I do like firmer beds like the one they had. Pillows are kinda small but as there were 4 of them on the king size bed, that wasn't a problem.  There was no noise etc. at any time that I spent in my room.. Just quiet and relaxing. Everything in the room was working and I took advantage of the little fridge to keep my sports drinks cool. 
The breakfast was a typical Hotel breakfast. The sausage was actually pretty good! The location is very good and lots of places in walking distance including the #1 rated Restaurant in the area, Peppino's.. There is also a Panera right in front of Peppino's. For those who prefer McDonalds, there is one right across from the Hotel. I did not use the pool but it appeared clean and inviting.
I think that with a little bit of minor maintenance (like painting the exterior right where the main entrance is), painting or replacing the front doors and replacing some of the ac vents that show some age, this should be at least one star higher rated.. I've been to 3.5 star Hotels that weren't any nicer than this one. I will likely be back at the Quality in in Lake Forest next year when I'm in the area again!",OlivierM698,2014-06-11

"I was attending a wedding reception close by this hotel.  We decided it would be a good place to stay the night rather than drive back to San Diego late at night.  It took sometime to check in because the manager was behind the desk and there appeared to be no help.  I was not expecting luxury first class service so I was ok with waiting a bit.  However I did not bargain for bed bugs.  We stayed the night, checking out on Sunday morning. Driving home I started itching. I looked at my arms and had numerous bits.  I checked the symptoms on line and it proved to be bed bug bits.  It is one of the most miserable itchy, ugly, things I'm living through... 2 days later I still have welts.  I'm taking a medication and using copious quantities of anti itch lotion.  BTW: we also noticed that the hot tub was filthy and opted not to use it...maybe this was my clue of what was to come.  No quality here, just bed bugs!",carlyny2014,2014-05-20

"We were in Lake Forest for a family reunion.  We arrived a few days ahead of others in our group.  The hotel was once nice but badly in need of updating. Soiled paint and peeling wall paper.  The hotel is clean enough but gives an overall shabby appearance due to paint and wall paper issues.  There was also a very large, beautiful chandelier in the lobby.  The chandelier had not been cleaned in a very long time and looked dull and dirty.
The hotel was understaffed and I had to go to desk to get items needed for the room.
The day the rest of our party arrived there was a small letter sized sign at the desk advising that the electricity would be off from 10 pm until 6 am.  Several in our group had small children and would need to be up changing diapers and feeding.  No electricity was NOT an option.  When the desk personnel was told they did not desire to stay under these circumstances, the hotel told them they would NOT refund their deposit.   
We would not have even known there would be no electrify if our group had not been checking in and seen the small sign.",perrjojo,2014-04-04

"When we (3 rooms booked) it was before 3 -2:15p.m. The two men in our party, my husband and another man were allowed to check in BUT the one woman in group was told she and her sister had to wait until 3. Why? So we all waited for her to check in. By the by hotel was not busy. Rooms were clean enough although our bathtub would not turn off all the way-so quite a waste of water. Hot breakfast? A joke. WE waited 20 minutes for scrambled eggs-they didn't materialize so I went to front desk-same guy as day before still didn't care and neither did the young woman preparing food. Remember the commercial ""1 potato, 2 potato...?"" No milk for cereal, no coffee (reg or decaf), no fruit just some remnants of what might have been an hour earlier AND ""breakfast"" still had 40 minutes to go. reiterating, hotel not busy.

"You get what you pay for.

Pros: cheap, especially if you get an Express Deal through Priceline. Spacious king bed rooms, adequate bathrooms and breakfast. Central location.

Cons:
1. First room had strong urine smell coming from bath tub. They switched me to a cleaner room that smelled better.
2. Internet speeds, especially at night for some reason, are slowest I have experienced in any hotel. Sometimes, I got dropped and could not reconnect without explanation. Front desk couldn't help obviously.
3. Could be cleaner.
4. Would you believe my room phone was dead? Front desk didn't believe me, told me I shouldn't expect a dial tone. Then we tested it and they believed. Nothing done to remedy that.
5. Except for the bathroom outlet and the one attached to the desk lamp, none of the other outlets would hold the plugs. They would fall out immediately unless you taped them to the outlet. I carry multiple chargers/ power adaptors and don't like leaving them in the bathroom. This is 2013.
6. Tiny, uncomfortable pillows.",CaliforniaRamblin,2013-09-16
"This hotel looks and feels old and outdated. We ended up here because someone booked it for us on a team trip. The location right off the freeway is convenient and its close to plenty of restaurants and other shopping and locations. Walking in the lobby is full of silk plants and the reservation desk has a ceiling overhang I could reach up and touch. As soon as I saw that one of letters of the hotel name had fallen off and was stuck to the wall away for its a original spot I took it as a red flag. The poor guy checking us in had some kind of issue and even though there was a list and room key envelopes laid out knowing they were expecting guests the check in process was long and painful even though we had a reservation. 

We stayed on the 3rd floor and I would highly recommend staying on this floor. We had a balcony you could actually go out on and a super high vaulted ceiling that made the room feel spacious. We had a 1980's wood paneled mini fridge, that worked. There was a large flat screen tv. But the bathroom was half updated making it feel a little awkward. The beds were comfortable but small we didn't hear cR noise from the Mcdonalds next door or parking lot below. Luckily we weren't spending much time there.",skittlebean,2013-09-07
"Someone tried to come into our room at 3am.  I was woken up by a loud bang, and thought I saw light by the door.  I just figured my daughter was in the bathroom.  Turns out she wasn't. I noticed the security bar was pushed against the wall the next morning, and realized someone did try to come in. 
I told the manager at the desk the next morning, he was rude, snotty, and asked why I didn't ""call him when it happened since he was there all night, there was nothing he could do about it now"". I'd already explained I didn't realize what had happened until I got up later.
Besides the fact that unless a person has the card keyed for the room, no one should have been trying to get in at 3am.
The breakfast was terrible, and overall the staff we encountered were very unfriendly.

The room felt a little dirty but wasn't worth complaining about, though it did smell like someone had been smoking in it and was evident by the burn on the bed sheets.
The positive thing was that after 10:00pm there was a lot of noise coming from the pool, we called the front desk and the clerk was apologetic for not having been aware but within 5 minutes of being told the noise stopped. ",tdem523,2013-08-15
"First the good: Centrally located -- close to highways, shopping, and restaurants. Housekeeping kept the rooms stocked and cleaned up. Wi-fi was slow, but free. 

Everything else was mediocre to heinous. The full breakfast wasn't very appetizing -- mostly pre-made stuff except for the waffles which you could make yourself. This ""non-smoking"" hotel was anything but. Smoke smell was everywhere. And we're not just talking cigarettes -- people were visibly lighting up pot on the balcony of their room. Worst of all -- the front desk staff, Jim especially, was exceptionally rude and did not exhibit the slightest bit of good customer service.If that weren't bad enough, a photocopy of my credit card (as well as others who checked in) was made at check-in -- even though it had already been run through the charge machine -- and when I found this out, he outright refused to give it back and said that he would have to check me out if he gave it back. When I did check out, he still refused to give it back citing that every hotel in the country does it. I reported it to my credit card company and they were appalled (they luckily reported it to their fraud division and sent me a new card).

Long story short, it was better than nothing -- but next time I'll pay the extra bucks and go to a hotel where they know the meaning of hospitality instead of trying to make you feel like they're doing you a favor.",macdeux,2013-08-10
"Checked in at 7:00 p.m. and my room wasn't ready.  Next day, came back to my room at 4:00 p.m. and it hadn't been cleaned yet.  Third day, the room was cleaned early but housekeeping didn't leave me any towels or pillow cases.

Staff is clueless and rude.  Hotel is old, dingy and smells.

Also, when I read ""Quality Inn and Suites Irvine Spectrum, I assumed it was next to the Spectrum.  Nope, its not.  5 minutes up the highway by car, 25 minute walk.  If you can't walk to a place in 5-10 minutes, you shouldn't advertise the location in the name of your hotel.",933ks,2013-07-31
"Check in time is 3 p.m.... or later. When we arrived at 2 and after we waiting in line for 5 minutes, we were told they were short-staffed and we would have to come back and check in after 3:30. Our choice was to leave or sit in their very dingy lobby. We left. When we finally got into our room at 3:45 it was less than inviting. Immediately stripped off the ugly, dingy, probably dirty bedspread and put on slippers so I wouldn't have to walk barefoot on the carpet. Cranked the air conditioner down to the lowest possible temperature because the room was stifling hot.

After a late-evening event we were forced to park in a poorly-lit parking garage and return to our room, past the out-of-order elevator, past the rooms where they store ""stuff"" with steel security doors with no doorknobs, through the filthy service corridor/walkway to the pool, to the only working elevator at the front of the hotel. Oops. Forgot something in the car. Didn't feel at all safe walking back to the car alone at 11 p.m.

Breakfast -- served only until 9:30 the next morning -- was mediocre at best. Flavorless. Minimal. NASTY coffee. Brown fluffy bread (you know what brand I mean) billed as ""wheat"" bread.

I suppose that the value was good, but I know there are other hotels nearby that offer rates just as good, with much better amenities. I've stayed there. Took a chance on this one.

This hotel may have Quality in its name, but zero in its accommodations. Won't stay there again.",Kerikns,2013-07-25
"I spent nearly a week at this hotel.  As a business traveler, my needs are simple: peace and quiet, hot shower, temperature control, wake-up call.  I was offered a choice of several hotels in the area by my client, and chose this Quality Inn because of the perks: free hot breakfast, parking, wifi, fridge and microwave.

Things started going south upon check-in, when the desk clerk put me in a room that didn't remotely resemble the one that had been booked for me: a king bed suite with a pull-out sofa and balcony.  Instead, I was given a regular room with 2 queen beds and no balcony or sofa bed.  The clerk said she'd move me to another room the following day, but although I saw her at the front desk literally every day that week, she never followed through.

I soon discovered the refrigerator in my room didn't close properly, and thus spoiled $15 worth of leftovers.  A male desk clerk replaced the fridge for me the following day--good.  However, that night the same female desk clerk failed to plug in my wakeup call for the following morning--bad.  Luckily I had my iPhone alarm as a backup.

On the second night of my stay, I was extremely tired, and at 8:30PM ready for bed.  I had no sooner doused the lights when a ruckus in the parking lot outside my window woke me up; it was a screeching chorus of hundreds of pre-teen children's voices, in a Chinese dialect.  At first I thought, ""Oh, surely they're just making a pit stop at the McDonald's next door,"" never dreaming the screeching throng would be checking into the hotel.  But they did, by the busload.

Yes, this rowdy group of at least 100 noisy children swarmed into the hotel lobby, which was just below my room.  In her infinite wisdom, the female desk clerk managed to book two groups of pre-pubescent boys--4 to the room--in the room adjacent to mine, and the one directly above me.  My room had a shared door with the room next door, and the kids continuously tried to enter my room, pounding and shaking the door as they hollered at one another.  The kids above me must moonlight as gymnasts, because they were constantly stomping and pounding on the floor, to the point that the ceiling and walls in my room actually shook.

After half an hour of chaos, I went down to complain to the front desk clerk.  She said ""we're getting a lot of complaints,"" as if our conversation should somehow end there.  Luckily, the hotel's manager, who is of Chinese ancestry and spoke the same dialect as the youngsters, appeared, and said he personally would speak with the children in the room next to mine.  True to his word, he admonished the kids to keep quiet, as did the 3(!) adults traveling with the 100+(!) children.  The kids did settle down; but the little gymnasts upstairs tumbled for another hour.

After another complaint to the front desk clerk yielded zero results, I finally went upstairs myself.  A young kid who couldn't have been older than 8 opened the door; he spoke enough English to understand what I was saying, and apologized for the stomping/jumping.  I asked him if there was an adult in the room, but there wasn't, only 3 other boys, none of whom appeared to be older than age 10.  All was well for about 20 minutes; then the stomping resumed.  Again I had to contact the front desk, and after about 30 more minutes, things were finally quiet.  By that point I had lost 2 hours of sleep.

The next morning I woke at about 7:30 and went down to the breakfast bar; to my dismay, the horde of children had descended upon it en masse, and 6 deep.  A tiny opening appeared in front of the coffee machine; I had no sooner edged toward it than 5 kids ran right in front of me, cutting off access.  Even more maddeningly, they just stood there, obviously not interested in coffee, merely wanting to cut in line just in case there was something they did want.  The poor woman who serviced the breakfast bar tried to wade through the kiddie swarm, holding hot dishes aloft and hollering ""excuse me, excuse me!"" to no avail, as the kids wouldn't even let her through to service the bar.  Finally, an adult connected to the group appeared, lectured the children loudly, and managed to get them to form a queue--which lasted for about 15 minutes.  I grabbed what sustenance I could and escaped to my room.

Shortly before I left that morning, I saw the children's bus outside my window; the kids were boarding, suitcases in tow.  ""Good!"" I thought, optimistic this episode was a fluke, that the rest of the week would be quiet, and the hotel would in fact revert from a playground to a hotel.

Alas, the following evening--and EVERY evening thereafter--a similar group of children appeared like clockwork at 8:30PM, swarmed the lobby, and treated the hotel like it was their personal, noisy playspace.  Same complaints to the front desk, every night.  Same problems with the breakfast bar ... every morning.

It's unfortunate, because this hotel had such promise in the beginning.  Yes, they're doing some things right--free perks, even underground parking--but there's no substitute for peace and quiet and a good night's sleep.  Business travelers, caveat emptor.",McWidget,2013-07-22
"We came to this hotel after leaving another nightmare place in the middle of the night. This was so much better! We travel with little ones, so our expectation's are not exceptionally high, being that we have to stay within a tight budget, but this hotel exceeded our expectations. Location was great, right off the freeway and in a good part of town. The breakfast was fine, better that most with the sausage and eggs. Orange juice was a little strong though. The room was a decent size and clean, beds were comfy. Nice bathroom. My husband used the fitness center and said that was a joke. Every machine was not only broken, but destroyed. Looked like there had not been a staff member in there to clean things up for fix the place in years. He said he also wouldn't touch the hot tub with a 10 foot pole. Didn't use the pool, but it looked decent. Lots of restaurants within walking distance and the staff was nice.",kandiw479,2013-07-07
Was really surprised at how nice this hotel turned out to be. The hotel lobby was very nice and the rooms were better than I thought. The staff was very nice and friendly. The location is also very nice being close to Irvine Spectrum. Would definitely stay here again,AnnetteM992,2013-07-07
"Nothing to write home about, but a decent place to lay your head at night. It's located right next to a McDonald's (for better or worse), but easy to get to from the highway. Hotel seems to be fairly old but they've tried to keep it up to par. Rooms are nothing fancy but simple and neat. I was on the 3rd floor and imagine these are better because I had a cool high slanted ceiling. Also mini-fridge and microwave were very nice to have in the room. Overall, not bad but nothing fancy.",Meliggy,2013-06-21
"I have stayed here many times over the past few years but I think I'll try something different in the future. The owner/manager is skimping on the small stuff to increase profits. Example, the ice machine on the 3rd level was broken so they removed it entirely and have no plans to replace it. (According to the desk clerk). You only get 2 bath towels, 1 regular and 1 decaf coffee. The sinks don't drain properly in more that one room I've stayed in and what rubs me the most is that you can book a room a month in advance requesting a certain floor and location I.E. facing away from Lake Forest Drive and when I checked in last time I was told that the rooms on the other side of the hall were already booked so I get the noisy room. Problem I had with this is the parking spaces were only half or so full. Who gets these rooms? Friends? Family member? So this has become a ho hum place to stay in my book. The breakfast is always good, the room is clean but they should wash the glass patio doors occasionally.",RoyR937,2013-05-28
"We have stayed at this hotel about four times in the last three years. Every stay it gets worse and worse. First they had a nice restaurant and bar that they closed down for no good reason. 
The meeting room had leaks in the ceiling which made the room smell like mold. They fixed the leak the next time we were there, but that smell might never go away. The hotel is clean most of the time, but at all hours of the night there is always some sort of party going on.
 
At the end of our relationship with this hotel, the manager was so sour and bitter, she slammed doors around and pouted.

If you want to stay at an average hotel, stay here. The front desk and other staff is friendly, but thats about it!",453ValerieB453,2013-05-22
We had a party there and the hotel and staff where great. The place is clean and well laid out. They did everything possible to make our stay a joyous one. A special thank you to Linda for keeping up on all the little details so the party would run smoothly. And thank you to the cleaning staff for afterwards. And the price was great for the nice rooms we had and the fun spa.,Micr0N,2013-01-03
"First impression was not great...our clerk was a bit odd and was not helpful at all, when we asked where the best place to park to be closest to our room he said ""anywhere on the property"" which was not the case... our room he said was ""just down the hall"" which was not the case.  He did allow us to check in a hour before 'check in time' which was nice.  The rooms were average..a couple of things that stood out to me were the bed spreads seemed very worn, you could not have the refrigerator and the microwave plugged in at the same time (but hey not all rooms come with such amenities.)   The heater worked great but it sounded like a freight train wreck each and every time it kicked on all through the night.  The hot tub was not working until the morning we left. One more added note:  The breakfast area offered a great hot waffle breakfast with eggs and bacon but is not in any way handicap accessible it is down four steps with no other entry, I watched an elderly lady trying to manage her wheeled walker down and the attendant was ""not allowed to help her down the stairs."" I would probably not stay here again I would try the Comfort Inn and Suites located just around the corner.",Cherith7,2012-12-26
"Stayed here for just one night.  It is in a very convenient location.  Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable.  Big flat screen TV was a surprise.  Breakfast was good - no complaints there.  Nothing special but a nice, inexpensive place to stay close to the I5 in Irvine.  I'd stay again.",RS191714128,2012-08-31
"My family and I stayed for three nights on a short vacation.  We had a few rooms for which we paid a little over $100/night for each room, which was a bit below average for the area.  Front desk staff was polite and helpful. The hotel is starting to seem old.  Little things like walkways needing to be pressured washed, handrails in need of paint and just basic maintenance.  The rooms could use freshening up.  They just felt a bit outdated.  Door lock card reader worked but you had to insert the key card a few times to get the door to open.  I did not smell the Chinese food that others have mentioned.  The hotel did include a modest breakfast which was a nice touch.  Not sure I would stay there again.  I think I would rather pay a bit more for a nicer/newer place.",785TomS,2012-08-20
"I stayed for 4 nights on a business trip.  Why I picked a Quality Inn considering my last experience with them in San Diego is beyond me but this one was a step up from the last one.  The grounds need some cleaning.  When walking up the steps to check in you can see there are alot of old drink stops that have not been washed in ages and it also looks like the steps haven't been swept in a while.  The room was exactly like the other except the bathroom was alot bigger and at least had more room for your stuff.  The bed was alright.  The breakfast was not too bad had plenty of choices.  If you want to have a drink at the bar has the front desk for a couple of tickets and you can get a glass of wine or beer.  It's clost to the freeway and the 5 minutes to the Irvine Center that has plenty of food, shopping and movies.  Stay out of the gym it is in the basement and creepy.  The equipment did work your better off going for a walk.  And the place had a funny smell from the time you walked in.  It is ok if you are on a budget and I have stayed at alot worse for more money.",virgo1252,2012-08-14
"This is a great place to stay, it is centrally located, prices are good, parking great, nice, helpful staff...everyone.  Noise level was not a problem even though it was close to I5/405 split, I'm a very light sleeper.  Easy freeway access, many restaurants within easy walking distance.  Breakfast - had plenty of items to choose from but I'm not a big breakfast eater, they kept the breakfast items warm and replenished often.",Joanie1014,2012-07-03
"I stay at Quality Inns often. This is one of THE BEST! Convenient location, friendly staff, pool, jacuzzi, spacious room, HDTV, couch, m/w, reefer, clean and modern and inexpensive. My room was nearest freeway w/ no noise issues, and on top floor (3rd) so I had high ceiling. High marks for everything ""important"" but... jacuzzi was only tepid and jets didn't work, breakfast was typical, but coffee was cold and proprietary waffles were ""flimsy"". I'll be back!",CTBurke,2012-07-02
"I stayed there for a week. Everyone was fantastic. Good Vibe!
The rooms were clean and decent.
Only negative remark would be to get new BACON noone likes Shoe String Bacon.
Free Happy Hour Drinks At the Bar if you're a guest, Awesome!",AngelitoBurrito,2012-04-19
"Bankrupt Films invaded the Quality Inn & Suites last week and our trip went off without a hitch.  The entire staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and they have complimentary drinks at the bar every day.  How can you disagree with that?  The hotel is located right next to the freeway and Lynda, the manager, personally went out of her way to make sure we had a great stay.  Can't wait to work down there again!",RobertD747,2012-04-19
This hotel is easy to get to off the 5 and is comfortable  enough. Breakfast is standard but adequate. Staff very nice and rooms clean ,drinkmilkCa,2012-03-11
"I previously reviewed this hotel in June 2011, and stayed here again through the holidays from about mid December through the first week of January 2012. 

As before, this hotel in the Choice Hotel chain is quiet, a great place to de-stress after long work stretches, or for travelers, or seniors just trying to get some peace and quiet away from the grandkids. Not a Party Hotel for the drinking set, but gets plenty of guests who don't mind their absence! Making reservations through the ChoiceHotels.com site worked best for me and was very competitively priced.  

  The Staff and Manager here go really out of their way to be friendly, efficient and professional - and which makes any stay here a real pleasure. Other hotels I have traveled and stayed with aren't nearly so nice usually - some feel  ""customer service"" ends the moment you check in. By contrast - this Quality Inn & Suites makes you feel at home. On some wintery cold nights the smell of their lobby fireplace wafting through the building reminds you of hotels as they used to be decades ago - but with all the modern amenities you expect these days.  The rooms are large, comfortable, very clean and well maintained, the beds are firm and have good heavy blankets - and coffee pots, microwaves and good small refrigerators set it apart really from lesser rated hotels. 

  Breakfast was great as usual, (though half the time I sleep through it- retirement is good for one thing at least!) but when I do get down to the spacious lobby dining area, the food is consistently hot, varied and tasty -and the line (if you go after 7:30 am) moves quickly. There's also a Chinese restaurant near the lobby that offers room service and has very decent prices for those days you just don't want to leave the room. WiFi is good for laptops and Androids, cell phone reception is good also. There's also a small exercise room on the bottom level next to a hot jacuzzi, one floor down from the very clean pool. 

   For a home away from home - this Quality Inn & Suites will be on my list of favorites for a long time.",MCTTravels,2012-01-24
Thank you Quality Inn & Suites very much for making our groups New Years Eve party a success! The staff was very friendly and helpful!  The accommodations were very nice and clean.  I will be coming back to the area in May for a business meeting and will be staying with them again. I have also encouraged co-workers to stay here as well!  Great Job!,SyndyP,2012-01-11
"I stayed with our group over the holidays. The staff was very pleasant and well organized. 
The rooms were clean and comfortable, with plenty of space to move around in. And the breakfast served had plenty of choices for the group.
Enjoyed my stay there and would definetly go back and do it again.",Wineguy1369,2012-01-07
I do a lot of business travel and I havn't seen a staff work as organized and swift yet. The front staff was very busy but the line moved fast and I got my room without a hitch. The room was much better than I expected. For the price I did not expect the number of amenities. I'm just glad they had a coffee machine. One thing I forgot about was the proximity to so meny neat restaurants and things to do. The Spectrum is an upscale mall with just about all you can imagin. This was the second year I'd been here and I look forward to the third or hopefully sooner which looks to be in summer.,BillS964,2012-01-07
We had a great time there New Years Eve.  We had a group of over 100 people.  We had breakfast in the hotel and dinner in their Chinese Restaurant.  This is the fourth or fifth time that our group has been there and we are looking forward to going back again next year.,DianeE285,2012-01-07

Great way to welcome in the New Year.",pams155,2012-01-06
"I was the organizer and we had booked about 1/3 of the hotel. They worked with me often to make sure things went well. The front staff was always professional and did what they could to fulfill all our requirements. They even placed my guest near the banquet room so the noise would be kept to only my guest. For the price you would not believe how nice the place is, tasteful decor in the rooms, the lobby beautiful. The breakfast the next day was lovely, even though the hotel had been fully booked the server was great and tried to accommodate everyone best to her supplies. And the location is perfect and easy to find. Plus it has McDonald's next door for those who want a late night nibble. This was our second year having a party and I would recommend this to anyone, even my Mom who also went to the party and had a great time.",Micr0N,2012-01-05
"When traveling to Orange County, I always stay here. It's not the Ritz but for under $80 per night, it is great. The rooms are clean, quiet and the continental breakfast is always good. Close to the 405 but not right along side of it. Mc D's is next door. They have a Happy hour in the bar (limit 2 drinks, beer or wine)",RoyR937,2011-12-22
"Such a tastefully decorated, seemingly recently upgraded place!  The rooms have nice furniture and comfortable beds, and the bathrooms have laminate counter tops and shower backing...a nice touch...and new toilets.  Wall paintings are  European seaside scenes...nice & airy.  Front desk staff in the afternoon were very helpful and professional.  
The exercise room was simple, but one could still get a bit of a workout wake-up!  (2 exercise machines need repair.)  The lounge area and breakfast eating area were spacious enough for gathering and meeting, should one need that.  Breakfast had multiple options, hot and cold.  Balcony was fun to have.  Some rooms were better than others, but front desk was very accommodating.  The plants and foliage were nicely maintained and added a pretty touch.  A nice experience!",HazelDell,2011-10-14
"Our soccer team stayed here during Labor Day weekend for a local tournament.   This was a terrific hotel, with 2 queen beds for $79.99 per night, including breakfast.  The rooms were clean and the beds extremely comfortable.   The staff and housekeepers are very friendly; our room was even cleaned twice one day!   Our kids enjoyed the pool and spa.   Breakfast is okay, with bagels,  bananas, eggs, and yogurt (get there early!).   We loved the proximity to lots of great family dining options, including Round Table Pizza and Panera Bread.  All in all, a very happy experience.",skypark91107,2011-09-12
"Our second stay in less than two months to visit ill family. Front desk clerk on days (a young guy, don't know his name) was VERY accommodating. On each trip the first room offered had a strong chemical cleaning odor (and one room was by the pool -- bad choice). When I complained, both times the clerk switched us to quieter and just as clean but near-odorless room. If not for him, we would have left, and missed an otherwise great visit. Breakfast is acceptable (cereals, eggs, waffles, fruit, etc). Rooms were clean and quiet. Air conditioner worked well. Balcony was a nice touch.  We expect to have to return to OC in the near future. We will stay here again.",RichardM252,2011-08-28

It offers guests a large pool area with a seperate large hottub area that can be reached by stairs or elevator.  The complimentary drinks in the evening is a nice touch and allows you to relax and chat with the other guests. The onsite restuarant was notable (even to our guests who do not normally eat Chinese food.)  The complinetary breakfast was enjoyable with hot and cold choices.",JadesJewels,2011-07-08
"Stayed here for a prolonged period (3 1/2 weeks) in May and June 2011 while vacationing and checking out the local resorts by the beach (5 miles away) scene. From Day One through the end of my stay--  I felt the hotel staff made me welcome, were friendly and professional, and knew how to keep you comfortable. ""Jim"" at the front desk was especially great - by the second day he knew me on sight - and greeted me by name. I haven't had that even at the Hilton! Thanks Jim! 

My room was a King Non-Smoking - Executive Suite (King Bed, work area and table, mini-fridge, microwave, wide screen tv, sofa and office style chair.  -- Very Clean- modern, well lit, sliding glass & screen door to the balcony patio -was very welcome for fresh air. The bed was comfortable, good pillows, heavy-weight blankets, fresh clean sheets and towels, and the bathroom was also very modern and clean. The heater worked fine, as did the air conditioner. The TV has a twin movie channel (ENCORE)which plays two different movies each day, CNN news and local news channels, and the usual fare of California TV channels. Free WiFi attracted me and worked flawlessly even late at night, and the Hot Breakfast was great - eggs, make yourself waffles, pastry, orange or apple juice, yogurt, - all fine. (The coffee- for me- wasn't strong enough - but ok). OVERALL I'd rate this Motel/Hotel FIVE STARS. Definitely worth your time!  

Note:  There's an average Chinese restaurant in the hotel - with ""average"" food. Ok if you are too tired to go out--but when I travel--I'm a bit of a gourmand and prefer much better dining - which in the Irvine Marketplace - just to the north off I-5 - is fantastically better. 

About a mile East on Rockfield Blvd -there's dozens of very decent restaurants also- and a very large plaza along El Toro Road for other kinds of shopping.  Ask""Jim"" at the Hotel Desk where ""anything"" is - and he'll give you written instructions on getting there!   

Other local motel/hotels in the area charge even twice as much - but I've found that the Quality Inn & Suites in Lake Forest can easily stand up to any of them for comfort, beat all of them in price, and match any in professionalism. I WILL be back.",MCTTravels,2011-06-04
"Booked a room for a night out with my wife.  Exceptionally professional & courteous staff at check in.  Very clean, fresh smelling, decently furnished rooms.  Bathroom was sparkling & well stocked.  Good water pressure in the shower.  Comfortable bed & pillows, not too soft or hard.  Not any noise/disturbance from other rooms.  Included hot buffet breakfast was adequate for the AAA price we paid.  Enough free parking, easy access from fwy.  The AC was a little noisy, & they could replace the tube tvs with flatscreens.  They have a stay 2 nights & get 3rd free deal so we'll be back soon.",MSK69,2011-05-31
"My fiancee and I recently had the pleasure of staying at this surprisingly accommodating hotel, it is centrally located right off of the 5 freeway close to just about everything. I went to High School in Lake Forest and never had the pleasure of exploring the hotel until now and I can assure you it does impress! It is quite affordable and as with all Choice Hotel brands everything was exceptionally clean and the property was very well maintained. The clerk at the front desk welcomed us warmly and the night auditor was exceedingly helpful when we checked out early. The only single drawback of the room was that the faucet in the bathroom was barely long enough to hang over the sink and consequently you cannot avoid bumping your hands on the sink while trying to wash them- nothing a little update couldn’t fix- other than that my only suggestion is an upgrade to flat screen LCD televisions but the room was just fine without one.",tsmoore88,2011-05-27

"I stayed at the hotel for two nights while I was in the area for a concert at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater and chose this for its proximity to the venue plus the reasonable rates. The service was tremendous and very helpful in getting me checked in, and the breakfast was very good consisting of waffles, eggs and sausages. Let me tell you it was nice getting a hot breakfast in the morning. 
The room was very comfortable and clean. I slept really well. I have had some hotels where the beds where miserable to sleep on but not here. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. 
I liked how the hotel was close to restaurants especially the Buffalo Wild Wings that was just down the block. It was nice having a place where I can go to dinner and have a few drinks without worrying about driving back to the hotel in a new city.
The only thing that I had a minor issue with was that the shower head didn't seem to secure, and not properly caulked in since I could pull it out a few inches from the wall when I tried to adjust the shower head but like i said that was a minor issue and didn't really spoil my stay here at all. 
The next time I am in town for a concert at Verizon I am definitely staying here again.",JHabib,2011-02-06
Hotel accomodations were great. Front desk clerk at night was awesome. She was very helpful but I overheard her lady boss raising her voice on her while standing behind the front desk which I really think was very unprofessional. Didnt get the boss name but I was not happy to see that. Other than that my stay was great.,cali_pat2003,2010-12-15
"We stayed last weekend with our daughter's soccer team.  All of the parents kept commenting about how nice the hotel was for the price we paid.

"My husband, dog, and I were traveling along the coast for vacation and to hit as many Dave Matthews shows as possible in 2010.  This hotel was one of the nicest we stayed in.  The bathroom looked like it had just been remodeled and the main bedroom was spacious.  Upon arriving there were a ton of kids there for a soccer tournament and thought it would be noisy but we had no issues. Great location too!  Close to Irvine Spectrum mall, easy drive to Laguna Beach, and only about a 2 minute drive to the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater.",Betsyin85308,2010-08-25

"I have stayed at this hotel twice over the past couple of months, with my last visit being in August 2010.  I enjoyed my visit both times, and would highly recommend this property to other travelers.  Only suggestion I would have to the current owners is to insulate the property from the aroma coming from the resturant on the 1st floor.  It is a little strong at times.  However, everything else was great, and I would definitely return if visiting south OC again.",jaghomeva,2010-08-14
"We stayed a total of 5 days, split over two weekends.  On our return weekend, the rates had gone up due to a local meeting and all hotels being totally booked.  However, the staff kindly reduced our nightly rate to that which we had paid the weekend before.   The rooms are clean and totally fine for the price paid.",Birdiebear188064,2010-08-14
I was very happy with this hotel.  The on line description fit the real place very well.  It was close to everything I wanted to do.  The staff was most helpful and the room an breakfast area was clean and great.  Even the cocktail hour was good. Would go back in a heartbeat and will recommend it to my friends.,41sunshine,2010-08-13
"Hotel is very pretty.  Lobby is beautiful.  McDonald's so close I thought we were parked in their parking lot!  Lady at desk, nice, but rough around the edges!  Gave us our key, went up to the room....TV on and suitcases....someone else already assigned to room.  Sat in hallway with kids while husband got us another room.  Bathroom was small.  Sink was outside of toilet and shower area.  Room was a tad small, but fine. Breakfast area was large, but still crowded.  Man filling the food was terrible at it.  Couldn't keep up.  Dropped huge boxes of plasticware on counter because he couldn't even keep those filled.  There were round eggs that were gross, sausage, cereals, breads, juices, coffee, and waffles.  There are two waffle makers....second one was over on the other counter, nobody noticed it at first.  Lots of little bugs flying around....probably because doors were open when we arrived the night before.  Chinese restaurant on property, didn't eat there.  Overall....good stay.  Stayed here because it was near Wild Rivers Water Park....literally like three minutes up the road.  Just stayed one night.  Was the most expensive hotel we stayed at during our trip to California from the east coast.  Payed about $130 with AAA discount. Nieghborhood was nice and felt safe.  There was an outdoor pool, but we didn't use it. Internet didn't work with my new lap top.",gymath,2010-08-10

"If you just need a place to stay and don't require anything fancy, this is the place for you. There's a small pool, but I didn't swim in it. The water looked kind of cloudy. But I wasn't there to swim anyway. The hotel has a weird setup in that some of the hallways are open-air, so you're outside in some of the hallways to your room. That can make it kind of loud at times in your room (if it's near the hall, which mine was) because you can hear people talking and rolling their suitcases down the hall. The room has a sliding glass door that leads out to a very small balcony that seemed kind of pointless to use because you couldn't see anything except other rooms (at least where I was). The breakfast included with your stay was a plus, though it's just prepackaged danishes, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, sausages and mushy hash browns. And coffee, tea, juice and milk. Better than nothing. There's free wi-fi, but my connection worked only sporadically. There's a computer and printer in the lobby that you can use, though. The night light in the bathroom was a nice touch. I saw in some of the other reviews people complaining about the smell of Chinese food from the on-site restaurant. You can smell it near the restaurant, but it's not that bad. Perhaps that's because my room wasn't near the restaurant--the smell didn't carry over that far. I would stay here again if I needed an inexpensive place to stay. It's located between a gas station and a McDonald's if that matters to you.",mln27,2010-01-01
"This stay has to be the worst. The TV did not work when I arrived switched rooms, could not get a hold of front desk many times, no answer, refridgerator did not work, lost food, staff did not seem to care or offer to help how to show how things worked. Maid put my blankets on the floor, and then on the bed. Staff hardly speaks English. Not shown how phone works. 800 line did not work. Bird poop near the pool, on railings, on balcony on floor surrounding pool.  Argumentive manager did not try to do better but argue he was right.  Staff at front desk not there a lot of times. I saw them on the computers a lot. Ran out of eggs 7:20 in the morning at breakfast.  No cable, no premium channels can do better for the money. Hot tub broken.  Was told by front desk the laundry worked it did not. Staff at front desk lied to me and said they did not know the managers name, but they gave the name to my father when be called. Unfriendly staff, musky smell in hall ways.  

Do yourself a favor and check out La Quinta or other, for they care about their customers...and will do whatever it takes to keep them...
..fix problems....Best West LakeForest does NOT CARE!!!",smartgalfreqtraveler,2008-10-11
"I am usually tolerant of economy motels, but I would not go back here.  To be fair, the property looked nice, and it was clean. The water pressure was good, and the iron and fridge were in working order. The bagels were fresh.  And I paid only $109 for a room with 2 queen beds.  But...

First of all, it was very humid inside. The weather outside was not, so it was clearly an issue at the motel. The room was strangely shaped, so the air conditioner was actually pointed at an angle towards a wall, rather than into the room, so it didn't help much. In addition, the exhaust fan in the bathroom was not very effective, and it just made the humidity worse.

The bed was uncomfortable, and the pillows were lumpy and flat.  The towels were thin.  

In this age of cable and satellite TV, there were very few TV channels available.

I can see now why motel rooms often have an extra sink outside the bathroom - this one didn't. Traveling with my husband and two sons, I did not have an extra place to do my hair, put on make-up, etc. I even had to move the coffee pot out onto the dresser, and had to announce myself as I opened the bathroom door to get water.

The staff did not replace the cofffee or cups we used on the first day.

Warning: While the water in the pool was nice, the pool had an ""L"" shape, and you couldn't see around the corner. A parent of young children would have to be particularly vigilant.

I thought that Best Western was a higher quality chain than some others in the area, but I was wrong.",Samantha_Marie,2008-07-07
"I stayed in this hotel for business travel. The room was just acceptable - clean, but not much natural light, and a little claustrophobia inducing. The main problem with this place is that there is a Chinese restaurant on the first floor, so the entire place smells of Chinese food. I like the food as much as the next person, but it was nauseating to smell it all the time. Plus I saw someone drying noodles over a bucket outside (seriously). 

The pool did not look like something most people would want to swim in. 

A colleague of mine got stuck in the elevator there for about 10 minutes, and the staff did not seem concerned or apologetic when she finally got out.

I stayed in a room toward the front of the hotel and was OK, but a friend of mine who stayed farther back said she didn't feel safe.

The continental breakfast is a joke - some apples, plastic-wrapped danishes, bad coffee, and hard-boiled eggs (which were my saving grace, incidentally). Generally nasty, and the smell of Chinese food doesn't help.",mudskipper27,2008-04-24
"I stayed here for two nights while my house, three blocks away, was being tented and fumigated for termites.  So obviously the location was ideal - I could easily go home to check my mail and pick up the newspaper out of the driveway!

Overall, I was content.  The room was quite quiet, with the soundproofing good enough to not be bothered by adjacent rooms or from the nearby Interstate 5.  The king bed seemed exceptionally comfortable, and the room heater easily kept the room comfy on a cool, rainy day.  There was adequate storage area, even for my wife, who brought a ridiculous amount of stuff for a short stay.   The wired and wireless internet connectivity let me use my three laptops without incident and with no disconnects.  There were two refrigerators and a two-burner stove which I didn't use.  Lots of more-upscale amenIties: Ironing board/iron, hair drier, coffee maker with proletarian coffee.  There was a sofa-bed couch.  The room was quite full of furniture for its size.  The continental breakfast was adequate, and there was a free ""Happy Hour"" that I used one of the two evenings to unwind with a rather mediocre white zin - I think Inglenook.  

The odd: The building is shaped like a tall ""T"", with the lobby at the base of the T.  I was at the furthest point possible from the lobby - the end of the cross of the T.  And the stairwell right next to my room only went between floors, not to the outside.  So while I might have expected to park near my room, in reality it was a fairly long walk to get to my car because the only hotel entrance is the lobby!

The bad: checkin was slow.  The single desk clerk was apparently processing multiple reservations from a travel agent or consolidator, reading off confirmation numbers as he typed stuff into his computer.  It took about  15 minutes before he would acknowledge me standing there.  The disposable paper-thin plastic glasses were a joke - happily I had brought a mug from home.  The bathtub was surprisingly small, and it had one of those impossible to use (and I'm an engineer) faucets which is either totally on or totally off with the dial rotation somehow adjusting the temperature.  Well, it took me as long as five minutes to figure out how to get passably warm (never hot) water.  The crummy clock radio seemed to be the one universally found in motels and which can barely receive the strongest AM stations without being overwhelmed by hum.  (Again, I brought my own.)  And there were insufficient electrical outlets; almost every one in the room was already used for something.  I coped, but wish I had brought an outlet strip as I often do.

Oh yeah - they allow pets, but at $50 / head I wasn't about to bring the four kitties.  They were boarded at the vet's, a fairly traumatic ordeal for them, but I would have loved to have them in the room.

So these few minor quibbles really don't outweigh the fact that I had a quiet, comfortable stay without spending a fortune.  I'd go back without complaint.

"It was convenient to make reservations, and it was pretty cheap, especially for the area.

BUT....

- My sheets had a funky stain, and there was hair on the bed, from several different people (blonde, brown, long, short)

- The carpet felt like it had been shampooed with hair gel. It was sticky, and it made my feet stick to my sandals... yuck.

- There were tiles falling out in the shower, and it looked like the tub was dirty (footprints and such) but it could've just been old.

- The room was non-smoking, but it smelled pretty strongly of flowery deodorizers on top of old funkiness, and since the window didn't open, the room hadn't been aired out in a very long time.

- The bed was big, but not very comfortable.

- Peeling wallpaper, holes in the walls from pictures that had been removed but not replaced, a funky red splatter pattern on the bathroom wall.

It showed all the signs of a hotel that has long since given up on upkeep.

There's a Chinese restaurant operating on the ground floor that smelled really good, but I didn't get a chance to try it.

"We usually stay in the area and could not get our hotel of choice and they suggested the Best Western.  It was aweful, the hotel has a chinese restaurant with poor ventilation and you can smell the food in the lobby and the walkways it ws disgusting.  

It looked as they just redid the lobby which was nice, but the rooms were terrible.  The worst condition, poorly decorated and the bathroom had avocado green tiles.  The sink was dirty and the hotel just had a terrible feel to it.  

The pool/spa/gym and the whole area was run down with broken concreate and it was just dirty.  I was to stay their for four days, but after the first night I moved to another hotel out of the area.  
This was one of the worst hotel stays I have ever had, it was just dirty.

"Their web site says they are committed to excellence, but the hotel was a big disappointment.  Located right off the freeway and noisey - our choice - it was shabby and run down.   If it was clean, it didn't have that impression because the property didn't look cared for.

"My Mom came to visit me from out of town and booked 3 nights here, at $135/night.  They checked her into a room directly above the Chinese restaurant, which as all the reviews have stated, stink up the place something fierce.  Well, this room had a bathroom that looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in a month. When we asked to have the bathroom cleaned, we were told that housekeeping had gone home for the day, and that someone would have to be called to come back in, and that this would take a few hours.  O.K.??.....  When we inquired as to moving her to another room, the only room available was in the main lobby, right next to the front desk.  Well, we found out the hard way, by me trying to call her in the room, that the phone didn't work.  They said they had no replacement, or anyway to fix it.  Needless to say, this is by far the worst experience we've ever had with a hotel/motel, and we have traveled all over the country.  It is an injustice that they charge $135 for a night in their facility. 
We ended up canceling the rest of the reservation after 1 night, and moved to Laguna Woods Lodge, only 1 more exit down the freeway, where the rooms were clean, the staff was very friendly, and the price was only approx. $85 for a single queen bed.
I would not recommend the Best Western in El Toro/Lake Forest under any circumstances.

"I have stayed here before, its not the RITZ CARLTON, but its ok.  Its overnight motel that I stay at.  I always stay usinge my aaa rate around $70, tonight they wanted $189 for the room since there was something going on in the area.  $200 for the same room that is not even worth 50 bucks.  I thought there were rules about price gouging.  When I explained that I have stayed here before the clerk didnt even want to heare about it.  She told me a the new manager wanted a higher rate because they can get it.   Well she may have gotten her extra 100 bucks, but you can sure bet I am not going back here again!

"May 15, 2006

Room 238.

We have just returned from 3 days at the BEST WESTERN LAGUNA EL TORO. It is by far the most un-inviting and dirty place we have ever been to. There is a Chinese Restaurant on the 1st floor that seem to stink up the whole place. The room was so-so. The day after our arrival the toilet overflowed and the whole floor was flooded. It was hard to close the door from the outside. One had to really slam it to close it. We were unable to get more than onetowel per person one wash cloth, and one small hand towel to share. There was a Hot Tub on the 1st floor hiddden under the stairs. That was the most disgusting pool ever soon. It appeared as if it was frequented mostly by transients in the area, whom all had easy access to the tub through a door to the garage that was supposed to be locked and only to be opened by a guest hotel key. 

The ""hotel"" offered a ""Happy Hour"" in a small bar that also served as breakfast room. The service was unbelievable poor. We got there apparently 15 min before the ""Happy Hour"" was over and we had a very hard time getting a cheap glass of wine in a plastic cup. That was our first, last and only visit there. Rarely does one see so many unfriendly faces in one place, here I am talking about the staff. 

If you park in the underground parking area, you may get poop from the exposed sewer lines on your car. We found ""stuff"" to be dripping from several different areas. 

On the floors, the breezeway doors would get stuck after they opened about 8 inches, and they appear to open the wrong way, so in case of an emergency you could be unable to get out.
Elevators were shared with the staff, and thay hasd priority over the paying guests. My advise to prospective guests: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY THERE.

"Please avoid this place. It is nasty, gross, disgusting, and unsafe. What a terrible place to even try to stay at for 
even a night. The room that was supposed to be a non-smoking room smelled badly and dirty with smoke residue. The carpet had huge stains as if someone had either vomited or pissed on it. The mattress was old, and the sheets did not look clean and were very thin. You walk around the property, you see trash and people smoking from their non-smoking rooms. There were people loitering around the property and you could tell there was suspicious activity going on with cars and people constantly coming in and out. There was even a sketchy guy circling the property on a bike for whatever reason. I was surprised how much of a dump this place was especially since it is not located in a bad area in Costa Mesa near the airport. We could not stay there because of how bad it was, and we stayed someplace else. Please avoid, and definitely don't take your children there.

The first day we put up the sign that there was no need to clean the room. And it wasn’t cleaned. Good. Next day we did not put up the sign because we wanted it cleaned. It wasn’t. We were then told that to get the room cleaned we had to alert the reception. Which we then did. The third day we left early and came back late, and the room was yet again not cleaned.

"I felt like the pictures posted on their page were highly deceptive. Not nearly as ""clean"" looking. Lobby was very musty smelling. When I gave my name they said I had reserved a smoking room. I said no, and she said that was what they had. I checked my receipt, and that's what it said, but I never reserve smoking. Then a man came in to check in and they did the same thing to him. I wanted to leave, but my room was already paid, and I knew I wouldn't get my money back. Took me a half hour to get my room because they were waiting for a clean room at three in the afternoon. Room itself had a table lamp, an overhead dome light fixture with one functional bulb, and no other light except the one over the sink. There were sconces on either side of the bed, but no lights. I tried to move the table lamp, but there were no outlets on either side of the bed. They had the clock plugged onto a hole in the wall behind the bed. 
I am not a particularly fussy traveler. I've stayed in places that were not the best, but were clean and comfortable. Nothing like this, though. The toilet paper holder was less than a foot off the ground. The door to the room had to be shoved open. The stairs were crumbling.

Since I can’t read a negative number I figured I’d go with terrible. My advice DONT STAY HERE! I have plenty of pictures to show all the things experienced. So first issue when I went to check in I was told I’d be placed in a smoking room which I’m not a smoker I said no I needed non-smoking so the two soft members went back-and-forth on what room they can put me in. Finally deciding on room 109 when I got to the room I noticed as soon as I open the door there was a horrible strong smell of mildew. Thought okay nothing Lysol can’t handle I went inside instantly noticed there was bugs on the bottom of the bed not even bothering to pull the sheets down to look.. I didn’t notice to the bathroom there was some little like devices left on the counter that I’m assuming belong to somebody else maybe the prior renters. The toilet was completely covered in urine and the shower look like it hasn’t even been rinsed with water.. The final straw for me is when I walk back out and I realize that the lamp was covered in blood yes blood… when I went to the front desk to tell them that I couldn’t stay in a room like that I was told they don’t have any other rooms and that it was nonrefundable and it would be my problem if I chose to not stay. ,michelleroper9,2022-07-25

"I booked and pre-paid for a two-night stay in a standard non-smoking Queen room at the Orange County Airport Travelodge.

We arrived about 9pm and checked in at the front desk, and were directed and given keys to a room, at the rear of the building.  We drove around, got armfuls of stuff, and swiped ourselves into the room – only to find it occupied by three people, who slammed the door in our face. Apparently no staff had noticed that the room had been neither cleaned nor vacated.

We put our stuff back in the car, drove back to the front desk, and asked WTF?  The receptionist said something like “oh they never paid for today”, and gave us keys to a different room, which was a room with two double beds, instead of a queen.  But at least there were no other guests in it.

The next day, we left the room and all of our stuff about 8am for our day’s activities, returning again about 9pm.  As we drove up, we joked “ha ha, I hope there are not people in our room THIS time”.  But alas, there were again three (different) people in the room.  We were flabbergasted.  Were they in there with our stuff?

Again, we drove back around to reception and again asked WTF?  The receptionist explained that since we were only booked for a single night, housekeeping had dumped our stuff in a bin to make the room available.  I showed her the two-night room confirmation, which puzzled her.  She said something like “I don’t know how this happened”, then made a bunch of phone calls.  She told us “someone called your room” to ask about extending our stay – but we’d left the room about 8am and so of course did not receive that call.  No one tried to call my cell, which they had.  The receptionist eventually led us first to the housekeeping room that had our stuff in a laundry bin, and then took us to yet another room.  When we inventoried our belongings in the bin, we found we were missing some items, including an irreplaceable gift given to my wife by her grandmother.  This room had no working smoke detector (a violation of federal law)  or door privacy lock, nor any coffee cups or coffee; and there was old coffee in the pot.  There were broken fixtures, mold, and cracked paint in various places.  When the receptionist let us in to the room, the TV was on and the A/C was blasting and set to 63, giving us the impression that it was recently occupied by someone. I suspect it too had not been cleaned.  But at least it had a queen bed.

When we checked out Sunday morning, the receptionist explained that a manager would call us Monday about our experience.  Of course, no manager called.  When I called them, I was told that ""only the general manager"" can give us back any of our money, and that he was suddenly called out of town for a family emergency.  Perhaps.  Or perhaps that's the party line whenever anyone has a gripe.

This was the worst hotel experience we’ve ever even HEARD of, let alone experienced.",douglas_c_thomas,2022-04-11
"Terrible, terrible, terrible. Waste of money.  Can't believe the majority of the staff is in customer service, nevertheless deals with people inn any way shape or form.  Rooms were aweful, incredibly dirty, over-ridden with cockroaches",flabit416446,2022-04-10
"My husband and I came here for our 24th anniversary, which we booked in advance as a non smoking room. We both have severe asthma and it was obvious that smoking had been done in the room. The toilets were not wiped down clean and the carpets were filthy. I tried to turn on the air conditioner to get rid of the smoke smell thinking it would help, but it made it worse! I even brought my own disinfectant spray, sprayed down the room, and wiped everything down but it still smelled of cigarettes. In turn that caused mine and my husbands asthma to flare up. So I tried to open the window to air out the room, and not 5 minutes later someone was smoking right outside our window, even though there are signs saying “no smoking within a 25 foot radius”. Needless to say my anniversary was ruined, I was supposed to stay for 2 nights but ended checking out the next morning after a one night stay. I expressed my displeasure to the front desk and I was assured people are not allowed to smoke in the rooms. I told her that as soon as we walked in the room it REEKED of smoke, and she never even apologized! The only good thing that came out of this visit was being able to get a 1 day refund for the night I didn’t stay. Don’t waste your money here! It’s not worth the price if you are not a smoker with health issues!",deanneb139,2021-10-02
"The room is acceptable. The towels in the room are thin and will not wipe the moisture after shower 
But the real surprise for me was the sign in the dining room saying that ""due to the shoftage of food some items will not be available""
So today no eggs no sausage.
Really???",apereg,2021-10-02
"DISGUSTING doesn’t fully describe the level of filth. After seeing what looks to be semen ejaculant, we immediately left the room, went the front desk and asked for a refund. They offered us another room, but after my wife and daughter saw what they saw, there was no way we would ever stay there again. The hotel refused to give refund. I hate them for taking our money and traumatizing my family!",toddcirrito,2021-09-21

"Everything has changed since new Indian owners have taken over this Hotel.
towel are now old and limited, bathroom paper is very poor, tissue mostly don't exist, pool at time needs cleaning -gets very cloudy, the breakfast was great at one point now the pancake machine and juice don't work, the bananas are almost black, the oranges are gone, the yogurt is gone.  Many days there are no coffee lids.
Much of the quality staff has moved on!  The prior staff was excellent and very kind and helpful.  Wyndham Hotels  should be ashamed how the name is being tarnished.  PLUS prices have been raised by 50% and you get 50% less!  Shame on this new owner!  Owner's have not ruined the excellent internet connection and Smart TV! Would not surprised to see that next!",wa265,2021-07-22
"Overall a good stay. I could get picky about some minor details but am happy everything worked properly in the room & I slept well for 3 nights.

Great location for being near airport but that's where it ends. Old and needs remodeling. Carpet in room dirty and only given 1 washcloth and 1 hand towel daily. Staff does a good job with what they have to work with. ,Edie452020,2020-12-29
"I love this place. I've been staying on and off for over 3 years now and it has never let me down. The rooms are spacious and clean. Housekeeping is also very good at cleaning and the Front Desk Staff is always very good in helping with whatever it is you might need. They do offer Hot breakfast instead of the continental breakfast so that was very much appreciated as it allows me to save on breakfast since it is complimentary. They also have a gym, jacuzzi and pool. From what the Front Desk told me. It is serviced 3 times a week so thats pretty awesome. Overall I love this place!",Erick9876543210,2020-12-18

Those scars are from this nasty place! I was in disgusting room 121! Beware people!,iloveweed1988,2019-09-28

"I based my reservation on the reviews here, so I have to post. In no way was this motel acceptable. Maybe because they put me in a room around the back, but it was unsafe and very dated and very dirty. I had to cancel the reservation within a few minutes. Thankfully the girl at the front counter did not give me a hard time.",pennell,2019-08-19
"Nice lobby with business center, car rental service,vending machines along with a super friendly staff.. Samantha and Juan!!
In rooms basic stuff,shampoo etc but has safe, good tv, nice size room, very clean, ironing board,luggage rack for a great price. Pool with BBQ, tables & chairs,loungers. There is a good restaurant right next door but many places to choose right across the street. Free shuttle to airport and Suncoast mall. I have to say you feel like your stay matters to staff. They gave a beyond a late check-out and I ask if I could enjoy the pool area after checking out for an hour before my flight and No Problem was their answer. A true Gem!!",meche2018,2019-08-14
Rooms are well-appointed with everything I needed. Bed was super comfy. I requested a quiet location and was very happy with the room in back of complex. Room was clean and recently updated. Staff was friendly and helpful. This place was a bargain for SoCal. Highly recommended for budge-minded travelers.,O8571LVjonb,2019-08-05

The bed was comfortable and the sofa a pleasant place to relax and watch television. Loved the beautiful lighting on the palm trees 🌴 around the pool.,H3866TCcynthias,2019-08-04

The bath had issues draining so water would pool at your feet while you showered. Not very impressive.

"Decent room for the price.  However, could update the electric outlets to make room functional better.  Also, bath's walls needed to be retiled because it is old and need a thorough cleaning.  Breakfast is good with make your own pancakes, bagels, egg & sausage patties, yogurts, juices, etc.

Stayed on ground floor but will stay upstairs next time because you can hear heavy footsteps and voices directly from room above.  Overall, it's a decent place to stay for a nite or 2.",lricketson,2019-04-27

"We stayed for just a night and it was fine. The bed is a bit small for 6' people, but doable for a night, especially if you don't have to share it. My only gripe was that I went to get ice and the bucket was full of the last guests' coffee garbage. Housekeeping must not have checked. The airport is close and the planes are kind of noisy, but they stop at night. The air conditioner is pretty loud, but that doesn't really bother us The pool is nice and there are plenty of places to eat nearby. The breakfast room was packed and not set up very well. We grabbed a few things and took them back to our room.  This place was adequate and priced pretty well for a short stay.",lauraa824,2019-04-22
"One step into the lobby and you realize that the property is dated. Rooms are no different; fully equipped with older furniture, dated paint and carpet with a tired bath. The beds while old, were comfy enough. The free WiFi worked one day and then the next it was spotty. Updated to a large screen TV, so that was nice. The pool
and hot tub got some use while I was here. Passed by the free breakfast, so no feedback on that other than it exists. There may have been a working girls here, but not in your face; this is not the type of thing to bother me and unless you’re paying attention you wouldn’t know. Quiet and conveniently close, so fit my needs. Cost somewhat reflects the expectations for the quality in the area. Would I stay here again? Yes. Very utilitarian, but not bad for what it is.

"Motion sensors in sleeping areas that trip when rolling over in bed do not lead to a good night's sleep.
Offering shuttle service that is not available does not lead to satisfied guests.

The door to my room was opened from the outside at 2 AM!  Luckily I had flipped the metal bar lock.  Called the front desk and they could not tell me why and offered no concern or empathy.

"My daughter and I needed a room close to the airport so we chose this. The area is not a bad area of town. Food places all around. The layout of the motel is weird. We had a room by the pool and had to park on the opposite side of the complex and walk through the lobby. Would be nice if there was parking all around. There was a family at the pool cooking and swimming until late and they were loud. The walls are defiantly thin. We were also two doors down from the breakfast room and that brought lots of noise early in the morning. The motel is definitely in the flight path for the airport because every 5-10 minutes we could hear a plane fly overhead. The motel is in need of updating. Everything is worn and does not look clean. I'm sure it is clean but due to the wear and tear, it looks dingy. The pull out couch has a large dip in the middle. If you plan on using this as a bed, just pay for the room with two actual beds. The wifi password is not given out or written down, you have to go to the front desk to get it. Its a series of numbers and not easily remembered so for each device you have to ask for it again.We had a flight later in the evening and asked for a late check out. They advised the latest is 1pm. At 11:30 housekeeping knocked on our door. We explained we were checking out later. at 11:40 another housekeeper knocked. At 11:50, another knocked and we explained about late checkout again. We decided to leave at this point because clearly they wanted to get the rooms clean asap. So we need up sitting at the airport for an additional hour. The shuttle driver was great. Very happy and helpful. Overall we will not stay again.",jfrye806322,2018-08-27
"I'll start by saying the room was spacious and clean; breakfast and parking were great.  The location is very close to the airport, freeway and restaurants (The Acapulco down the street is wonderful). We booked 3 nights, but unfortunately we felt it best to check out after 2 nights due to noise both in the room above and right outside our door at the pool and hot tub.  From the room above we heard every step, jumps off the beds, running around, etc.  Our ceiling creaked loudly with each movement...the same group ran up and down the stairs and was partying at the pool all night and it was frustrating, so we called the Front Desk around 1:00am the first night and 2:00am the next. I know it's tough to control guests who are determined to be rowdy and loud; however it was impossible to sleep.  We decided to check out after 2 nights and the morning Front Desk agent was very helpful, promising the Manager would call us. We received Cynthia's call the Monday following and she was fantastic.  She listened to us and apologized for all the inconveniences and explained that the company who booked their employees into that room (Orange County Fair vendor) are no longer welcome at the Travelodge. Cynthia offered exceptional service, and we appreciate her help. I would stay here again, but would ask for an upper room and away from the pool, which may help.",amynN7864GU,2018-08-17

In the past I was booked into a larger, more expensive property nearby so I was a bit concerned about my first-time stay @ this location.

Location is near lots of things and we found it easy to navigate to Newport and Huntington Beaches from there. Our only complaints were actually pretty minor - the room had automatic lights that came on at night when one of us got up (easily fixed with some tape over the electric eye, suggested by the amazing staff) and the toilet paper holder was 11.5"" from the floor (we measured...). No one on the amazing staff had an explanation for it and were as perplexed as we were... Made for good conversation.",NutHouseMama,2018-06-29
"We very rarely leave such negative reviews, but our experience was bad.  We would not recommend this hotel.  It was old (outdated unlike the pictures online), dirty (shower, floors/carpets), and the bed was ridiculously uncomfortable.  The guests next door were loud and stayed up past midnight.  We were visiting for a work trip and incredibly disappointed.  
We were also hoping for a better breakfast selection, it was served in converted hotel rooms with limited space.  We will NOT be returning to this Travelodge.",heatherlee2018,2018-06-12
"Clean room, comfortable bed, decent size and upgraded countertops and bathroom. Didn't use the pool but it looked clean. Staff were excellent. Let us check in early. Breakfast was a typical continental: bagels/toast, yogurt, fruit, cereal, coffee, and they added eggs & sausage along with a pancake maker that I am not sure worked since no one was using it. 

The only cons had to do with noise. The convenience of being close to the airport also comes with an extremely loud noise from the airplanes overhead. Thankfully the curfew kept us from being up all night but it was surprisingly loud. ",alimariew,2018-05-15

Old motel with a need for new carpet. Otherwise the room was ok but in need of an update. The WiFi was also not very good. We did not try the breakfast. The location was great however if you need to catch an early flight from John Wayne or find a place to eat. I would stay in this area again but find a different motel.,fehlow,2018-03-07
"Don’t expect much. It is a motel. The room of clean but carpets felt dingy and I didn’t dare walk barefoot on it. The thing that bothered me most was that the shower head had some build up on it and hadn’t been cleaned before I got there. There was mold on the tub faucets so that was super gross. At first I thought there was construction in the building but it turns out the water pipes bang on the walls when someone turns on the faucets! What I especially didn’t like was that you can smell cigarette smoke when the whole place was supposed to be a no smoking area. There should be a designated area for smokers away from the windows and doors. However, the service was great and the people at the front desk very helpful. ",greyes335348,2018-02-20

The Hotel was average for the price. We weren’t expecting a 5 Star hotel or even a 3 Star. Just expecting a comfortable bed and a place to shower while we visited friends last minute. The biggest complaint I had was the water in the shower went from scorching hot to ice cold no matter what you did. The beds could really use new pillows.

"First room we were given smelled of cigarettes. They didn’t have any other similar rooms available, so they upgraded us!  That was nice of them.  But once you’re given a bad room, you can’t shake that feeling that efffects the rest of your stay.  You start noticing things like the stain on the sheets, the chipped floor tile, the oddly placed toilet paper roll (less than a foot off the ground), towels that don’t smell as clean as you think they should, and the sink fixture that sits too far back so you end up splashing water all over the counter just to wash your hands. 

For the price, more expensive than Motel 6, I had an experience that was only slightly better than what I’d expect to get at a Motel 6. 

I did enjoy the complimentary breakfast though. Simple options, but it was included in the price. ",andrewrP5962DV,2017-11-08

Also, the parking lot was repaved the day we checked out requiring me to move the car and hand carry my luggage thru the lobby to my car. Notice was given but only the night before. 
Internet was unusually slow for a motel.
All employees were very pleasant to deal with.",budman8017,2017-10-16
"The grounds are in decent shape...  Front desk- service was great always friendly and helpful...  Breakfast- was good, but could use a bacon day instead of the sausages everyday kinda deal... Our room- was in poor shape... As the carpet was very old and musty and buckled in places, we had burned out lightbulbs that we told front desk and never were replaced... In the bathroom the shower had a poorly patched (if) it had ever been repaired??? Not sure!!!  water leak on the ceiling and don't get me started on the shower faucet!!!  Could not get it to even out to warm so one moment you would be burned and the next frozen...  Sink had no stopper and the smell of stale sewer water was present.  The door had to be jiggled to be set in lock position and we had the smell of marijuana coming through the vent at all hours!!  The photos on the site are not accurate of rooms and this hotel could use a face lift in them... If we had not been just coming and going as we were visiting family and friends for a long overdue visit home it would have bothered me more and left as it was really not worth the price we paid... As a place to lay our heads down after all day visiting it was okay...   Bed was comfortable and the pool and spa relaxing... ",577eddiev,2017-10-13
Samantha the woman at the front desk was so helpful. Customer service is 💯✔ here.. They have kids pool toys in the pool area. They have an amazing breakfast!!It is extremely clean and the maids do a wonderful job. Above all there customer service is 💯 amazing!!

"They told me the owner saw me go to my room with multiple people and called and knocked on my door, I showed them it was only me and my girlfriend and they dropped that. Then ended up getting robbed because they said the sheets were stained and charged me 16$ for 2 sheets and 12$ for another for used sheets that had some makeup on them that comes off if you wash the sheet. She didn't even know how much to charge, she just made up the prices as she went. These people are criminals  stealing deposits because they know they can find something to pin on people that can't fight back. ",719473uu2u78,2017-10-09
"This hotel is average or below average. The people are generally dumpy and the facilities are nothing to write home about. You get what you pay for, or a little less that what you pay for in this instance.",joshualW2352WM,2017-09-15
"The room garbage bin did not have a bag within it ,so we had to leave it on the table. Then the shower had a major problem. .the water was going from extreme hot to extreme cold without being touched .
Now the bed was like a concrete mates se and me and my wife kept turning interrupting our sleep
This was a very very bad experience.
Cannot recommend to anyone",928irwins,2017-09-14

Registration lady very nice and hellful recommmending a restaurant in the are. There was a huge roach in the bathroom in the middle of the night. The room could have been cleaner.,lindsayp145,2017-08-25
Dirty and in disrepair - the bathtub had been recoated and the hardware was coated over.  Rust was coming through the coating.  The carpet was filthy.  The amount of noise from other rooms indicated terrible noise mitigation.  A couple people were smoking pot in the parking lot.,Q6155BAbarbarap,2017-08-23

"All good. Amenities, nice pool and jacuzzi. Some low life-rs smoking weed on the stairs (very young people) and wouldn't move out of way to allow the use of stairs. Left their trash onstairs on purpose to prove they were low level humans. But cannot seem to get away from that around airport properties.",robertfA1501RP,2017-08-20
"The room and furniture were old and didn't look like clean. The hair dryer was broken and couldn't be stopped without pulling out the plug, I didn't report it as long as it could work. There wasn't enough water pressure in the shower as well. The wall was paper thin and you could hear everything happening outside, and the internet was very poor and unstable. However, the location was convenient and close to the convention I was attending. The only thing appreciated was the continental breakfast despite the lack of available seating. ",romildal2017,2017-08-18
"I stayed at the Travelodge OC from une 29th to Aug 9th, and my first couple nights I was in a end room in the back, had no problem with the location, except the ceiling was cracking and molded in the bathroom from a obvious water leak above. The manager, Cynthia, addressed it and moved me to another room that had been remodeled the previous year. And it was actually a deluxe, but she charged me the same price as before. More then enough to remedy the situation. The next room was pleasent and very comfortable, with 1 exception. The lights are all motion activated, which is a tad frustrating when you turn over in the bed and the room lights come on in the middle of the night. Happened to me most nights and in some instances a couple times per night. I dont know if that is the setup in every room, but something to be aware of. Or you can just sleep like a vampire and not move, :-) But other then that, the room was great. I plan on staying again, although I may not stay in room 203 again. ",bridgerc2016,2017-08-11
" Our room was nice it was one of their remodeled rooms in the hotel.  I didn't like the fact that there wasn't a separate closet area ,the closet was right in the bathroom  by the sink.  The pool pump in the swimming pool went down so the pool was starting to get dusky looking.  I wish there was a source of good protein for the breakfast   Besides those ready-made egg pancakes  that were warmed up in the microwave and then put it in the warmer     The staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Internet connection was awful it was all Wi-Fi and it was really bad I wish they had a hardwired connection in the rooms as well.  The room was very clean.  I stayed with my whole family and it was nice having two connecting rooms. 
overall it wasn't a bad stay for the money ",O1664RXsvetlanas,2017-08-06
"The rooms were dirty.  The shower was HORRIBLE and the temperature of the water could be adjusted to either scalding hot or ice cold...no in between.  We checked out after one night and they billed us for 5,  will not return.  ",wendyfW6116KZ,2017-08-06

"This is a close, relatively inexpensive, clean, comfortable place to stay while at the Clinic. Courtesy mini van service between the airport, and the Clinic is provided. Only challenge was waiting 47 minutes to be picked up from the clinic, one day, 30 min the next, and 10 minutes the final day. 
I loved swimming in the outdoor pool !  Genesis grill at poolside for guests to use. No elevator to 2nd floor. Friendly staff. Breakfast could be improved. High carb offerings prevailed. I do not like Yoplait brand yogurt. Greek yogurt would be an improvement. Small coffee cups. Pre cooked eggs left a lot to be desired. Sausage patty and links were good. I would rather have warm hard boiled eggs available !",catherinewF748HN,2017-07-17

The hotel provided a really good breakfast there was always someone there to make sure breakfast items were stocked.  The only problem we encountered was the person that was above us was up all hours of the night stomping (not walking) back and forth.  The hotel manager was apologetic and we we're appreciative of what she was able offer us.  We would stay there again..",michelleaZ7132PG,2017-07-10
"Spent less than 12 hours here in between connection flights. Arrived at SNA after the shuttle driver was off for the night so the hotel graciously reimbursed me for the taxi, with receipt from taxi driver! Very impressed. 2 miles from airport, very convenient.

Room is clean and very decent. I'm a 40 year old female and I felt safe alone on the property. Lots of nextdoor noise like thumps and elephants walking lol and water pipes noise from above but, whatever. Air conditioner worked awesome in room 110.

Pool area is nice altho I didn't use it I checked it out and it's clean and has decent shade.

Free ""continental"" breakfast was really great! Sausage patties, links, egg rounds, cereal and milk, coffee, juice, pancake maker (fun and yummy!), breads, English muffins, yogurt, fruit... great offerings! Plenty available an hour after it was open.

Scheduled a shuttle back to airport for the morning and when I went to check they had me all signed up on the clipboard. Nice that night crew actually communicated with morning.

The only ""complaints"" I had was the main room light and bathroom light are on a sensor so when you get up for the restroom in the middle of the night they come on and the feel BRIGHT!!! Also true only available outlets for charging things and using my CPAP machine were behind the bed or behind fridge, under desk. Not easy to access but I made it work.",GrammySmells,2017-07-08

There was a tiny problem that honestly I could've taken care of myself but I called the manager to ask him if he could take care of it and he even refunded me some money for the inconvenience so that was another plus. The staff was super friendly and personable. Was an amazing stay. Bathrooms were super updated and clean as well as the whole room and free cable and fridge &  a microwave too. Extra blankets were already there by the closet. It was just really great and they supply pool toys for kids it was just great over all thank you travelodge!",daleshkag2017,2017-07-04

"Ok, I stayed here last year and I was pleased with a refurbished room and helpful staff at a great price.  So I felt comfortable having my wife stay here when she visited California (normally I would have paid a little more for a Fairfield Inn or something like that).  But apparently not all the rooms are refurbished -- her's did not at all resemble mine, and it smelled of urine.  The put her on the second floor, and apparently there is not elevator, so she had to lug her luggage up the stairs (I didn't realize this as I had stayed on the first floor). Also, the breakfast was very minimal.",TKB71,2017-06-29
"The hotel is very close to the airport, but the noise was coming from other guests.  The walls must be very thin, because I heard way too much.  There was also a spider in the shower.  He had been there quite a while.  The property is need of an update.  The lady serving breakfast was awesome.  She turned a terrible stay into a poor stay.",K3795PImichaelp,2017-06-28
"They say you get what you pay for... and what you aren't paying for at this Travelodge is sound dampening.  All night long you can hear the snoring of those in adjacent rooms, the clomping of people walking outside, whatever is happening in other bathrooms through the vent in your own bathroom.  The list goes on.  If you are a heavy sleeper this likely isn't an issue, but the constant noise of other guests and employees did not lend itself to a good night's sleep for me.  On the plus side, there is laundry on site and the room was decent.  There is a continental breakfast, though the options were few and not fantastic.  Parking fills up quickly, so we weren't always parked close to our room.  ",rstebner87,2017-06-28

"Travelodge is one of those brands that you really can't (or shouldn't) get too upset if there's not a mint on your pillow and your towels aren't folded into origami swans. They're not a premium brand, and if you get an affordable room without crumbs in between the sheets, that's pretty much what they're there for. I stay at premium brand hotels and boutiques fairly often - so when the occasion is better suited by affordability than luxury, I try not to be too judge-y.

All of that is to say that this is an *exceptional* Travelodge. The lobby was probably the cutest of any I've been in - and designed to feel more like a ""Hotel"" than a motel. Here's my breakdown:

1. Clean. Very. My fiance wasn't well during the visit and she would have been much more critical than usual and she had no complaints.

2. Water Quality. Meh. Some places you can drink water from the tap, some you buy bottled water. This was a bottled water place. Not Travelodge's fault, really, just a general observation.

3. Noise Level. If you walk across the street diagonally from this hotel, there's a convenience store. That store adjoins airport property. You will hear jets. If hearing jets bothers you, do not stay this close to the airport. The rooms are reasonably soundproofed but not robustly so. It didn't bother me in the slightest - but I know people who aren't unreasonable individuals and they'd have been table flipping and stuffing wads of TP in their ears to try to block the noise.

4. Wi-Fi. There doesn't appear to be wired internet anywhere, so WiFi is your only option. If you like to travel with an AppleTV like we do, you know you prefer wired internet. Otherwise, it's irrelevant. The WiFi signal was very strong from my room, though this might well vary throughout the facility. I was on the second floor reasonably close to the lobby.

5. Internet speed. This was terrific when I checked in, but absolutely *tanked* the first night, becoming unusable. I switched to my hotspot and blew through a lot of data that weekend. Speed did not suffer the second night ( a Saturday) - suspect we had neighbors with a data consumption problem similar to our own.

6. Cell Reception. We had good reception on both AT&T & Sprint.

7. Cleaning staff. I don't know why every hotel recently sends staff around to knock on doors at 9am. Knock it off. They *did* respect the DND sign when I put that out.

8. TV. Typical basic cable. Remember when Motels used to say ""Free HBO!"" outside? No more.",eddieo170,2017-06-20

Only had problems with the tv remote, and a stain on the couch.  ac and heater worked well and there was a fridge, thats always a plus! Would come back anytime. Also, if they had dimmers for the LEDs would be a nice addition as they all turn on and are extremely bright, not a bad thing, unless you wanna have lights on but not too bright.",Charkzzzz,2017-06-13

"I stayed here for a conference held at the Westin about a mile and a half away. Check-in was a breeze and the attendant was very friendly. I spent less on three nights total here than the other attendees for my conference spent on one night at the Westin. It's super quiet-close to the freeway and I felt safe checking in late at night solo. The room had a table and chairs, a separate desk and chair, tv with HBO, microwave, fridge, iron, ironing board, hairdryer, toiletries, coffee maker w/coffee, and the housekeeper folds the washcloths into cute ruffles. It's very clean-no complaints in that department. I haven't tried the free breakfast but it's there. The parking and wifi are free as well. There are plenty of restaurants and gas stations nearby, and the mall is just up the street. 
My only complaints are 1) that the mattress feels a little worn-kind of sags in the middle and not a ton of support but I slept ok; 2) the hot water in the shower surges with scalding water without touching the faucet. If you crank up the cold water, it becomes freezing. Never quite found the happy medium. These aren't deal breakers though. I'd absolutely stay here again. ",KristenG76,2017-05-28

The room needed to be aired out better before we arrived, but to be fair they originally had us in the 2nd floor and my mom requested the ground floor at check in, so they were trying to be accommodating. The only other noticeable thing was every now and then a small plane would fly overhead making conversation impossible for a moment. All-in-all a great value for the weary traveler not looking for excessive luxury.",alreneh2017,2017-05-19

I believe the rooms could use some updating for sure.",947tylerh,2017-05-17

"I was picked up by shuttle at John Wayne airport...about a 20 minute wait in the sunshine... didn't mind at all as I was coming from a winter storm. Arrived at 2pm, an hour before check-in time, and they were kindly able to accommodate me right away, in an updated room...I had requested 2 beds, but no longer needed them, so I ended up in a nicer room with one bed and a pull-out sofa. My room was close to the lobby, the pool, and the breakfast room. The bed was very comfortable.  Was it a little noisy? Sure...you can hear airplanes, you can hear through the walls, and you can hear pool noise. Did I particularly care? Not really. I'm always prepared with ear plugs when I travel, and I know what to expect when I'm paying lower rates. There are many places to eat nearby, so you won't starve if you're not mobile.  The pool looked pretty clean, but I didn't try it out. The hot tub was a little green and smelly the first time I went in, but was much improved the 2nd and third times.  The breakfast was pretty typical, nothing spectacular, but it was good. I didn't want housekeeping service every day, but when my room was cleaned it was done well, and smelled nice afterwards. I asked for a late check-out, and was allowed to stay until 3pm for an extra $30. Seemed reasonable to me. I had a lovely stay, all the staff I encountered were friendly, and I will stay again if I'm back in the area again next year. Be realistic with your expectations and you won't be disappointed...a great value.  ",F7622AWmichellep,2017-04-29
This place needs an update.  Beds and bedding looked old.  There were nats everywhere on the outside of our door and when we opened the door to the room they all went inside.  We spent the next hour trying to kill them all.  Carpets were dirty also.  Just gross!,W4055BCvirginiam,2017-04-26

As we were getting ready in the morning, we noticed a lot of airplane noise, but it wasn't an issue at night and did not disturb us at all.

"Our stay had been a pleasant (and quiet) one up until 10:30pm when a group of men decided to turn the pool area into their personal frat house.  Music blared - Dancing amongst each other ensued - All the while drinking.  Things escalated to singing and hollering then leading to throwing chairs, tables, and deck umbrellas into the water.  The fiasco came to a horrifying head when 2 of the men stood at the edge of the pool and urinated into it.  

Despite 3 calls from our room and multiples call from other guests (as front desk reported) it took an hour for someone to come out and put an end to the madness. Incredibly too long to get a handle on something this disturbing and illegal - Especially for those distressed guests with children

The Hotel is very well located, in front of various restaurantes, just 5 minutes from de Airport and the staff is very friendly.

The hotel is in a very convenient area, room is confortable, good (included) breakfast, but taking a shower was a nightmare. The water temperature changed from warm to boiling every 10 to 15 seconds.

There was a 60"" flat screen television. The bathroom was very nice with good water pressure and hot water. I definately recommend if staying in the Costa Mesa area. ",robn457,2017-02-25
This is an older property. At least some of the rooms have been refurbished. The rear of the property abuts a golf course. Ask for a room on that side to avoid the traffic noise out front. I got in late and left early so I cannot comment on Internet of breakfast.,psptraveler,2017-02-19

Sure some of them could use a little touch up with paint here and there and some new tiles and grout in the tub area but overall it's a nice place.  Big rooms, very comfy beds (I always sleep well here), nice breakfast and a nice location with plenty of options to walk to for food etc.  Travelodge is not a 5 star hotel chain but if you are looking for a nice, clean, comfortable place to stay that has excellent rates, give this place a try.",carola73,2017-02-15

"We stayed here because we used it as a lay over to and from Mexico. It was relatively inexpensive, had excellent shuttle service, and breakfast. I had never seen a ""pancake"" machine before. Normally it is a waffle maker. You press a button, batter drops down on a conveyor belt and comes out the end ready to top with butter and syrup. You can push the button more then once so you have several coming out in short order. They also had egg ""patties"", sausage and the other usual stuff.

The front desk personnel were very quick and friendly. As was the shuttle driver.

There are varied restaurants within walking distance. Bill's Burgers was right on the corner of the parking lot and has much more varied menu then you might expect from a burger joint. The burgers, however, were good.",Y3720RIrichardg,2017-02-01
Great if you are just passing through. Check in was easy and staff was very nice. Thin walls. We heard our neighbors at 1am. We needed a very early taxi around 4:30am because their shuttle service starts at 6. The cab was 20 min late and the front desk was not concerned about us at all. We almost called our own taxi. Other than that it was a pleasant stay. Plenty to eat near by. We left early so we didn't not get the free breakfast. We would come back. ,nicolebE4897NG,2017-01-28

"I stayed at the TLOC due to an event in the area. I stayed in a first floor room on the back end of the building, away from the road. It was fairly quiet. 

The room was basic and clean. The hotel is obviously older, but in reasonable shape. The room keys are touch keys that do not need to be inserted into the lock, but just touched to it. 

The room was comfortable and clean with microwave, fridge and TV. Everything seemed to work fine. In the bathroom, water leaked from the handles in the tub, but it did not affect the shower. 

The office staff was courteous and quick. There is apparently an opportunity for car rental from this location and an airport shuttle. There is also a restaurant in front, though I am not sure if it is expressly connected to the hotel. 

Breakfast is included with your stay. There were eggs and two kinds of sausages along with all the normal carbs, waffles, toast and the like. There was also yogurt, which I find to be a special treat. 

This hotel is south of and just a few mins from the airport, making it convenient and yet off the path. There are restaurants near by.

"I am always very happy with my stays at the Travel Lodge – Orange County Airport.  It is a comfortable place to stay, very convenient to the airport (8 minutes), and all of the front desk employees as well as the housekeeping staff are friendly and efficient.   Furthermore, there is a car rental agency co-located with it, that provides excellent service without the confusion of the airport car rental concessions.  During my last stay, I was especially pleased to note a new mirror on a swivel connection to the bathroom wall, allowing me to look at the back of my hair as well as the front, and to get a closer look at my makeup then the regular bathroom mirror allows.  In addition I really appreciated the ceiling light as well as table lamps, that provided plenty of light to work on paperwork in the evening.  Finally, the TV provided a wealth of TV stations.

Gaaaah
OK, I'm there 3 nights.  They'll get it tomorrow. I take a picture, sleep, up early, go to work (not using tub). Back that night and waaaaat? ITS STILL NOT CLEANED. I actually had to wipe it a little to make sure it wasn't rust or something, nope, blood.  OK.  This is getting gross. I do notice that they did not change sheets, and didn't vacuum since there was a shirt clip where I'd dropped it.

So they don't clean. And you know, that blood staining was STILL there when I left for good this morning. So, 3 nights, and NO BATHROOM CLEANING.

And you could hear the TV blaring next door, I had to turn the A/C fan on to drown it out. 

In short, if you expect a clean room, DRIVE RIGHT BY. 
Blood.  And they didn't clean it. That's a new one.",trader1272,2016-10-12
"Check in was fast and friendly, explained Breakfast next morning, issued Wi-Fi password. Drove around to our room. A lot of what appears to be abandoned cars and vans parked in rear of hotel. Most covered with dirt, expired license plates, and some damaged. Apparently there is a car rental agency that has an office in the lobby of hotel but they seem to occupy more than 50 % of the parking spaces at the hotel. The room was nicely furnished with a sofa bed, desk with chair, King bed, dresser, flat screen tv, microwave, & refrigerator. Furnishing are older but workable. There were ant all over the bathroom vanity sink area and in the bath tub and walls. Previous reviews mentioned same issues, must be on going problem. Toilet seat was loose on the toilet itself so you had to be careful when using it. Do not know why issues with ants and loose toilet seat were not corrected by housekeeping staff. Room was very clean and enough towels were left for two guests. Air conditioner was efficient and reasonably quite. No issues with motion lights coming on at unwanted times. Only thing to remember, this is a lower cost hotel, so there are a lot of construction workers and possibly Section 8 guests staying here, it may not be the best choice for a traveling family. The pool and spa is large and appears well kept up. Breakfast was good, with standard fare. Hot sausage and egg patties, three types of cereal, good selection of breads & bagels. Coffee and juices. When checking out, noticed someone was sleeping in the car next to ours in the parking lot, again this car had signs it had been sitting there for quite some period of this, dirty with trash accumulated under it. Not a real safe feeling !! Upon checking out, we left a one of the maintenance notes from the room with the front desk about the ants and loose toilet seat. Seriously doubt we would stay here again if in the area due to the surrounding of the hotel.",jimwI7309XU,2016-10-11

The 1st night our room seemed comfortable even after we found a couple of ants in the bathroom. When we woke up Friday morning there were ants in our bed. Absolutely not acceptable & the desk person moved us to a larger room that had been newly remodeled. While the larger room was much nicer than our previous room it was definitely an  inconvenience to move everything as we had settled in for a three night stay.  We came back to the room Friday night fairly early as we had a very busy day ahead of us Sat. We decided to turn the lights off early to get some rest. Within minutes the light in the sitting area came back on. I got back up to turn it off & again it turned back on right about the time I fell asleep. Husband had fallen asleep and stayed asleep as he can sleep through most anything. The light kept coming on numerous times. I had tried everything with this sensor to no avail. Between the hours of 1 & 2 am I counted the times it came on (11 to be exact). I finally went to the office as I had called them earlier in the night and he offered to come check it out however I didn't feel comfortable having him come in while my husband was sleeping. So I asked for some masking tape or something to cover the sensor. He gave me grey duct tape and I placed it over the sensor so it could not read any sort of wind blowing or dust particle. The light situation continued through the night and I'm lucky if I got 2 hours of sleep. When the light would come on no one had moved. Not one motion for it to go off. They did say maint. came in Saturday while we were gone. However the light cont. to come off & on. Every time I spoke with a desk person they were very personable but honestly that is all they had going for them as they didn't seem to want to help me in any way other than apologizing. While that is nice I wanted SLEEP. I finally was told I had to speak to a mgr which would not be available until Mon. I left my # as instructed & waited for a call. I finally got tired of waiting & called them myself. Was told that she was on the line & would be off in a minute. I waited for my return call & decided to call again. I was told that she was on a conference call. I was asked to leave my name & # and I explained to that now that I know she was on a conf call that I would wait. Samantha called me back within 5 minutes as the mgr told her to call & handle it for her. She apologized & ended up crediting us one night. while that is nice it would have been better to sleep!,139jessej,2016-09-20

"My wife and I recently attended the CR Summit at Saddleback and needed a hotel that was relatively close by.  We had a rental so we could stand some distance.  We were at the summit for all of each day we were there so we just really slept and showered at the hotel.  We also ate the hot breakfast, which was a plus.  The room wasn't big, but it was spacious enough with a King size bed, couch fridge, microwave, iron and dresser.  We was clean and well kept.  The bathroom was small, but clean.  The shower did become disconnected from the wall, which was caused some leaks.  The A/C worked fine.  The only annoyance was that the lights were controlled by movement sensors so they came on and went off at inappropriate times.

I had checked around and finding an affordable hotel that would be able to shuttle me to the airport was not easy to find.  There were less expensive options, but once you added in a taxi the savings would be lost.  I had never stayed at a Travelodge as an adult.  My perception was that this is a lower tier chain.  My perception was either incorrect or this has got to be one of their best properties.  Don't misunderstand - this is not a luxury hotel, but the room and property were both very clean and nice.  The bed was firm and comfortable.  The TV had a feature that I have not seen before in a hotel -- pause/rewind/fast forward -- just like on a DVR enabled TV.  The breakfast was fine -- their were a couple hot items.  The shuttle was convenient and prompt.  All of the employees I spoke with were helpful and pleasant.

Most places have waffle machines now a days. It was free so what do you want.",dr528,2016-04-25
"Good hotel, very clean. The only issue was that the room on the second floor still smelled smoke. Why? Because the first floor had smoking rooms and the smoke travels up?.The attendant said they were all booked and there was no other room to change to. I woke up with headache the next morning.

"I was a little worried about staying here due to other reviews. I had nothing to be worried about. This hotel is great! The room was great, bed was comfy, room was spacious (It was my husband, 11 year old, 8 year old, 2 year old, and me) and had lots of room, and the noise from the airport wasn't bad at all! The property was beautiful. Short drive to beaches, any food you could want (burger place next door is excellent by the way!), and tons of shopping centers. The breakfast was ok, get the eggs and pancakes, but that is the restaurant not the hotel. We only planned on staying 2 nights, but ended up staying 3! Overall very impressed!

The over all appearance of the place leaves a lot to be desired. The check-in staff was rude and shortcoming. Personally wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!",karely777,2016-04-11
"I booked two rooms & was given 150 & 146. Check-in was quick, but the lady wasn't very hospitable, no smile, no thank you for staying with us, she acted like I was inconveniencing her. Room 150 reeked of cigarette & they gave us a different room upstairs. My family stayed in the downstairs room & my parents took the upstairs. The rooms were fine, clean, & had toiletries and a mini fridge. Breakfast was next door at the onsite restaurant. It seems a temporary situation. There was a line of guests at the door at 6:30 a.m., but the restaurant was not prepared. It was inconvenient, because everyone was trying to hurry up and get something to eat before they had other plans for the day. Everything was still being put out, the bread wasn't fresh & the made to order breakfast took a long time & was tiny proportions. The man was very nice, but under prepared. The rooms was 20 minutes from the Catalina Flyer & served it's purpose for us, but I'd only stay here again if I had to because of the price.",SereneEcho,2016-04-07
"There was a mixup with my rate and I ended up having to pay more than what I was led to believe. The front desk clerk that helped me was very rude and lacking compassion. Even after I started crying.  I understand that the rate shown on my confirmation  is the rate I was expected to pay, but I wasn't aware of that at the time, and felt conned into joining a program that ended up not benefiting me.  Then the room smelled like mildew. The sheets looked they were never changed. They weren't crisp, smoothed out and were super wrinkled. AND there was a hair on my pillow case! Gross.  Then the shower water continuously switched from scalding hot to cold every couple of seconds. So until I realized I would have to settle for a bath, I got burned in the face twice.  And despite requesting a room far from any smoking rooms I had to deal with the people in the room next to me and going out onto the landing to smoke cigarettes. I have asthma and I'm extremely sensitive to cigarette smoke and this ended up being a real problem.   Smoking should not be allowed within 50 feet of a non-smoking hotel room. These people were standing right outside my door and window.   And then the only coffee that was stocked in my room was decaf and when I called the front desk to request regular they told me I had to walk all the way to the reception desk to get it. I was in the far back of the hotel, just woke up and was in my pajamas...Not very good customer service!  Very VERY disappointed in my stay...too many downers.",841nataliaw,2016-04-06

We got into our room 150 around 8pm and right when I opened the door I saw a roach run into the AC/heater . I told my kids we aren't staying in that room. We went to the front desk and explained what we saw and they gave me another room . We went to that room which was located up stairs. We walked in and I saw another roach . We walked out and I just said we wanted our money back. I had to find another hotel to stay in at 9pm at night . Never will stay at Travelodge again. The guy that helped me was very nice. It's not his fault he works in a roach infested hotel .,covergl1000,2016-03-23
"The stay itself was fine but I was called out of bed at 11:30pm to give payment information that I had given months prior. I was sent a booking confirmation and I replied asking if there was anything else you needed from me as well as some other questions and I never received a reply.
The lady on the phone was rude and short with me and gave me the feeling that I was bothering her, she then left her post in the middle of me trying to get confirmation if my emailed arrived. I had to explain everything from the beginning to the guy who took over. My emails never made it, he had to give me his private email to send the information over. I was told I would be contacted by management the next day which never happened.",pedromY4074DC,2016-03-21

"My 16 year old daughter and I wanted to take a trip to Cali and experience the beach, so I booked a hotel near the beach without spending all of our budgeted money. Travelodge has a decent reputation so I was confident that our stay would be enjoyable. I didn't expect the drug deals in the parking lot, the eroded door that left a gape you could see through, bumpy/caved in mattresses, nor did I expect mold in the shower! Disgusting.

Stayed here for 5 days spanning a weekend.  Price was outstanding.  Room was spacious and clean enough. Mattresses were comfortable. Parking lot  appeared to be busy place. Good Neighborhood though.  Easy access to expressways from this location.  AC worked well.  Microwave and small fridge in room in working order and clean. Internet connection also very fast so I could do work. Would have preferred to not see the exact same framed art / picture on 3 of the walls in my room but that had no impact on the usefulness and function of the room.   ,citygirl950,2016-03-14
"This Travelodge is just what you'd expect from an economy motel.  Old motel, many coats of paint, but clean, with newer TV, microwave and mini refrigerator.  Also cute towel origami (see picture).  Breakfast was served in a dingy Greek restaurant with poor service and poor quality food which included scrambled eggs, bacon, and potatoes or pancakes.  It was not good, but you really can't expect too much from a motel like this.  This Travelodge met my expectations.",JimU917,2016-03-12
The place was ok.. clean.  Safe. The free breakfast was at restaurant next door.  Lady there was way less them pleasant.  I recieve 5 pieces of cubed potatoes with breakfast. Saturday my daughter didn't eat her bacon with her breakfast - she doesn't like it so I ate it.  Sunday morning the lady brings ky daughter her breakfast wuth no bacon. She's like oh she didn't eat it yesterday. I td her bring it I'll ear it. OK experience.  Hotel waa good but the morning breakfast experience was not so  good.. not sure if I'd stay there again.. room next to us played loud music all night and kept walking out in courtyard talking really loud at 1am.. room above us ppl were stomping around till about 4am..,scottrT5713FX,2016-03-05

Cleanlinest was not satisfactory and the comp breakfast was a joke. We had a chose of scrambled eggs with pancake of potatoes. The worst eggs I've ever had and the first day no potatoes!  The lady collecting the coupon was  only interested in collecting the coupon.  Cleanlinest did not exsist,  in the four days we never saw a person wipe the tables and when we were finished eating we put our paper plates and etc. in a plastic bag laying on the floor by the serving table.......yuukee!!!!~!!",josephk258,2016-02-19

Nearly 20 minutes later a female walks through the door carrying what appeared to be coffee for two. We get to our room and its badly in need of repair. The shower would suddenly turn cold or hot and remain that way for some time before switching back. Breakfast was next door and we had to stop at the front desk to get a ticket. The breakfast was cold with small portions and the coffee was empty more than it was full. The last night we were there the room next to ours erupted into a drunken fight that lasted most of the night and resumed at 5AM. As we were packing to leave we found a crack pipe between the dresser and the fridge. ",dsc0tth,2016-02-19
"Service was friendly and helpful in answering my questions about brochures and my reservation (booked online).  Motel is situated along a business district, close to strip malls and restaurants, and is well-lit outside.  

The room had amenities I expected for an average motel stay (microwave, refrigerator, iron, hair dryer, cable TV, free wi-fi, etc.), and the rooms had modern lights and decor.  Noises between rooms weren't too loud or bothersome.  My room was well-cleaned every day of my seven-day stay.  I preferred to eat breakfast in my room, so I skipped the breakfasts.  Vending machines outside of the rooms were a nice convenience and not overpriced.  The only major drawback are the aircraft noises from the nearby John Wayne Airport, but I also chose to stay at this motel because it's close to it; a local family member told me planes don't operate from 11pm to 7pm there, but if you sleep in after 7am, be prepared for some noise.  Despite that, I would stay again.",michelletR7130PD,2016-02-16

"I stay at this hotel often, at least 4 times a week and its not because its nice, but located near my office.  First off the rooms could be alot nice with little expense and im not sure why its not done.  So out of the rooms ive stayed in there has only been one tub that worked properly.  The other ones either do not drain and you shower in dirty water or you can not not plug it and you cant bath.  The wall paper is literally falling off the walls in some rooms and should be just removed and painted to look way nicer.  The toilet seats in some rooms, 136 off the top of my head is one that the seat wont stay up, so as a man you have to hold the seat up with one hand and blank with the other.  Also several rooms have dirt and mold around tubs which actually removes pretty easily and make the appearnence of bathroom MUCH better.  Some of the doors have up to a 1/2"" gap, that light comes thru the door at night and so does the sound.  Pretty easy adjustment of the plunger mount on door frame to seal it tighter.  No garbage liners, i know its probably to save costs, but staying in the room and eating and disposal of foods after a few days isnt practical.  The internet is super slow, hard to complete tasks for work and most of the time have to use my own hotspot cause it is so slow.  These fixes wouldnt run very much in expense and would make visitors stays more enjoyable. Just some honest feedback from a frequent visitor.",989claytonh,2015-12-26

- card keys to the door won't open unless you try 10x
- AC doesn't work
- Desk chair is broken
- bed is uncomfortable and itchy (bed bugs?)
- there are no cabinets
- the lobby smells
- did I mention the AC doesn't work?
- there is no iron in the room
- the phone doesn't work
- they give you a wifi password, but when you connect, it asks you for a username that was not provided

I found a hole in the wall, receptacles hanging out, very corroded faucets, and some very noisy neighbors well into the early morning hours. The wifi was very weak which will be a problem if I come back. On the positive side, the bed was comfortable and clean. I noticed on my way out that a whole wing of the hotel is being renovated.

"This location appeared to be below capacity, yet I was given a room right next to a construction zone where rooms were being renovated. As a result, I was treated to loud hammering, loud saws, and yelling workers right outside my door in early in the morning. 

The room was riddled with cigarette burns on the carpet and sofa, and the bed had hair and food crumbs under the sheets. There was also some sort of substance splashed all over the bathroom door, and the edge of the bathtub was covered in cigarette stains.   The bathroom sink had so little water pressure that I was barely able to shave in the morning.

I was also puzzled by the fact that the employees allowed an unattended, seemingly abandoned piece of luggage to remain in the hallway near my room overnight. 

My stay here easily ranked in my top 3 worst, most abysmal hotel experiences.

I expressed my dissatisfaction immediately upon the entrance in my room with Ray the condescending attendant. It was to late to cancel, I can't sleep the room is nasty and questionable. I would never ever ever patranize this business, my husband is a gold elite member and I'm shocked he was refused a upgrade after seeing this room and being told the pictures advertised are for upgraded rooms , what a sham.

That being said it was under construction, I was told the work out facility was closed, and breakfast was next door not but decent still. Looks like one whole section is being updated but no problems with noise here either. The staff was great and the pool and spa enjoyable. For being directly by the airport because I was only there at night I never had a problem with noise. The bed was comfortable and it met my needs. For a solo business trip overall not bad for the price, probably would stay here with my family but still not bad. I needed something I forgot and the staff at the office went out of there way to help, even left something behind and after calling they had it ready to pick up the next day. Good experience!

Additionally, upon returning in the evening, there was a profusion of unsavory characters hanging out, arguing among themselves, and watching you come and go.

"Costa Mesa Travelodge is undergoing some renovations. The new rooms, if you get booked in one, are very nice; however, if you were unlucky like I was, you'll be put in a beat-up, stained room that dates easily to the 1950s. Though the guestroom was clean when I arrived, there were strange reddish-brown stains on the ceiling, the shower was very old and made high pitched noises when turned on, the guest in the neighboring room was smoking in the non-smoking section, and I was confronted with insects throughout the room. When I called the front desk to inquire about cab service in the area, the receptionist flatly said that she ""didn't know about this"" and hung up on me. 

Travelodge Costa Mesa should not be booking guests in their old rooms. It wouldn't be as big of a deal, except that I found out about the new rooms through colleagues who were also staying at the hotel, booked in the new rooms at the same price that I paid. ",741arielw,2015-05-20
"This was my worst hotel experience , dirty , smoke smell,old carpets, room stinks, very old and damage furniture, trash under the bed, spurs of very hot water at the time of showering I had to use the ice bucket to rinse to prevent burn eruptions on my skin, towels like sandpaper, no continental breakfast, No laundry after 9:00 pm

Suttle not available etc terrible service it seems that they are going  out of business. ",28fernandol,2015-03-27

"This place is a joke! The bathroom was old and rusty. The handles for the shower were laden with rust inside. The drain was black. The tile was dirty. The plug shorted out every time I used it. Try flat ironing your hair with the iron shorting out every couple of minutes. The lights would turn off everytime I plugged something in. I would then spend a few minutes trying to keep the lights on. 
There was no air-conditioning in the rooms. It gets hot in those rooms! Also, i thought there was breakfast included. They failed to mention to me when I checked in that their breakfast room was under construction. Whick is 2 rooms together to make the breakfast area. I had to go to the lobby in the morning, get a voucher then go next door for breakfast ( a restaurant). Didn't have time to wait for the restaurant to cook the oe of 2 meals you can choose from.
Don't be fooled by the decent looking lobby. The whole place is under construction. They even turned off the water for 2 days from 11-5. To top it off there is no elevator. Alot of fun going up the stairs with my big suitcase to the 2nd floor.
The location however was perfect for my needs. I was there for business. That's the only positive thing I can say.",171nadiac,2015-03-15

Very nice hotel. The only thing is that it seems that the parking has become over crowed and i see the same vehicles there every time i have stayed. Seems like a lot of work trucks and cars. So it has made it hard to park close to your room sometimes.  But i still enjoy my stay each time. ,657kimberlyb,2015-03-02

"I had stayed at this hotel before and it was ok for the price. I work in SoCal so I stayed for 6 days. I don't know what happened but this hotel has gone dramatically downhill. Dirty room, questionable bed linens, old bagels, brown bananas, no moisturizer, shampoo and coffee in the room each day.  The last night the hotel caught fire and they relocated me to the Starr Inn that was about 10 times worse (if you can believe it).  A hooker-like hotel. Absolutely disgusting.

"This is a Travelodge, It's not a Ritz Carlton. If you don't confuse the too, you will find this to be a good value. The room I was in (215) appears to have been redone recently. It faces the golf course, so traffic noise was not an issue. I needed to a place sleep, as I was attending a seminar at the Westin South Coast Plaza (about ten minutes away) the next morning, and I wasn't interesting in spening the $200+ that the Westin was chargin for a room. This Travelodge serves breakfast, but I did not have time to try it so I can't comment on it. I would surely stay here again if in needed a hotel in the area.

Added bonus to have a fridge and coffee in-room, a barbeque area by the pool, and free continental breakfast. Lots of restaurant choices within easy walking distance, and convenience stores right across the street. The beach and shopping were an affordable cab ride away. The hotel offers free shuttle to certain destinations which is a nice touch if they remember to come pick you up. This is not a frilly hotel but certainly affordable and a great place to hang your hat and tour the area.

Filthy Room. I discovered live cock roaches on the bed and walls
Dirty sheets/Bedding

"I expected my room to be on the same scale as the lobby.  The lobby was very nice.... my room, not so nice. I like a bright room and because I'm a woman traveling alone, I need for the light to be produced by indoor lighting. I turned on the lights and noticed that one lamp was unplugged.  The outlet was behind the bed.  When I tried to plug it in, the headboard fell off.  The room remained somewhat dark, even in the sink/vanity area while I was getting ready for an event and trying to do my makeup.  The ceiling was stained and basically, the room itself just looked old and beat up.  It was clean so housekeeping should be commended. It was a very, very hot night and I needed to have the air conditioning on.  Unfortunately, I couldn't adjust the direction of the air vents and they blew directly on me when I was in bed. Not good! Not good at all!  It took me hours to fall asleep.  Also, all of the pillows were the exact same size, none of which were good for my neck and the sheets couldn't have been any rougher.  I'm sorry to be so negative but it was a pretty miserable night for me.  ON THE UP SIDE - The price was right and the grounds seemed to be safe!!  The location was good and there were plenty of convenient restaurants nearby, including a drive thru Starbucks right across the street.  I appreciated having this Travelodge as an available option to me who needed a place at the last minute and even more, I sincerely appreciate the fact that you still offer smoking rooms to your guests who smoke!  For that fact alone, if I needed to come to the area again, I may stay here (but I'd bring my own sheets and pillow.)",madalynwho,2014-10-12

"Great customer service can erase a lot of things… but in this case I feel like customers should know what I'm about to tell. For your own health…

I flew into OC to stay with my best friend and cousin while she was receiving cancer treatments. Note: this hotel is a ""recommended hotel"" for the particular treatment center that she was attending. After a long day and late night we were both exhausted. I climbed into my bed turned off the lights… several times in the night, with my face buried in my pillow I smelled something sort of putrid. In the morning I awoke and smelled it again and lifted myself up to look at my pillow which stained and dirty… I asked my cousin if slept in the bed the night before (as she had arrived a day earlier than I), thinking that maybe she had bad morning breath or BO or something. She said no. I then climbed out of bed to look at the sheets and I had been sleeping in sheets that had fairly fresh stains of blood and bodily fluid at the level of my torso. I picked the pillow up and there were blood splatters and stains on the sheets under the pillow. At this point, I felt sick, and worried, given that this is a hotel used for disease center patients. 

I asked the cleaning lady to look at it and she routinely changed the sheets. I then talked to the hotel staff who had a maintenance person come in, unsheet the now fresh sheeted bed, and look at the mattress. There was a deep, dark stain. He immediately got help and they took the mattress out and brought a new one in.

First, how could the cleaning people ever miss this?! It was fresh, and a very large area and a prominent stain. Not faint at all. Some staff person looked at the bed and looked the other way, not wanting to deal with it, or simply didn't care to change the sheets after a room had been used. 

I'm sure I'm fine, but I'm haunted by this experience. This was the worst filthy hotel experience I've ever had. And I'll check the sheets carefully in every hotel I stay in from now on.",kimmD1359TX,2014-10-01

"Stayed here for four nights in mid-September.  Room was clean, quiet and reasonably comfortable.  Had a king size bed along with a couch and a nice desk to work at.  Refrigerator was more like a freezer as almost everything I put in it got frozen.  The knob to turn down the temperature was broken, but not a big deal as mostly what I stored in it was water anyway.  

The breakfast is pretty much worthless.  Couple of different kinds of cereal, bananas, apples, juice and coffee.  Better than nothing, but just barely in my opinion.

Very easy location for doing things in and around Orange county.  All-in-all, I was pleased and would stay here again.",cthore94553,2014-09-20

It was spacious, and had a decent sleeper couch to sit on while I worked.  The sink area has been upgraded to a nice dark marble,  and it was very quiet overnight.  The property is very close to the airport so you shouldn't be surprised when planes take off,  but the noise ends between 10 pm and 6:30 am, so a quiet room overnight is the norm.  I will stay here again next time business brings me here! ",shanniemac,2014-08-24
"The room was OK, it was bearable.  First of all, finding this place was a nightmare. It's not where Google maps shows it (I know that's not really their fault, but that's a pretty easy fix that the hotel can make).  The problem with this is that we called the front desk multiple times asking for directions, and the guy was so unhelpful it drove me crazy.  His inability to give simple directions such as major crossroads was unbelievable. 

The air conditioner was broken (1 of the fans wasn't working- we didn't realize until our last night, so that's on us).  They switched us to a new room, so at least that was nice.

One night I called the front desk asking for extra pillows and towels, and they said they'd call me back in 10 min.  I never got a call. 

The food for the breakfast was terrible but it's the same as any other 2 star hotel, except these people didn't even have a waffle maker.  It was basically cereal and bagels with some fruit. 

Overall, I would definitely not return..",zoopanda,2014-08-11
"Stayed here for a few days. Lots of complaints from us. I'm just going to list the problems we had so that others can be prepared for issues. First, they have too many cars in the parking lots. You can't find a place to park because of the used car dealership in the parking lot. The first day we were here, maintenance guys were washing loose tires and rims, as well as bicycles in the parking lot. They have a lot of crickets outside the doors that chirp all night...When having a shower, the water goes from hot to cold in 1 second, so the shampoo burns your eyes because you jump out from the freezing cold water. I also had a sunburn, and the showers water made this worse by the temp changes. I ended up just having a freezing cold shower because I couldn't wait all day. The shower head was clogged from hard water stains, so it only comes out on the hard pressure setting. It was like taking a shower with a garden hose. We didn't have enough towels, and the office was rude when we asked for clean towels. We started washing them ourselves to avoid the rudeness. The breakfast room had a roach crawling up the wall, next to the bananas.They had hookers out at night hanging over the upper balcony. I felt like I was staying at a low budget Motel 6. The queen size beds are actually full size beds, comfortable but tiny. Airplane noise didn't bother us. Tv's were nice. Fridge worked. I would move the used car lot out of the parking lot, and provide more towels for your guests. Because those were my main complaints. I wouldn't stay here again just because of those issues. I would have expected this from Motel 6 but for the price it didn't match the service. I would happily pay $100.00 to another hotel for clean fresh towels, and a place to park that was remotely close to my room. The maids seemed nice. Whomever manages this hotel, is not doing a good job, and probably lacks management skills. When you walk into the lobby, it looks very nice, but when you get your room, you will be sadly disappointed.",soccermommyof3,2014-07-19

"Stayed five nights. Went well. Our room was nice. Checking in was fine. The last day there, I went to the lobby to use the computer to print my plane ticket for the next day in the morning...and the lady at the desk was talking to other customers there. First off, she sounded rude to them. Second off she gave me a weird like of confusion. Comes upto me and says ""excuse me mam...are you a registered customer"" I said ""ummm"" before I could say anything she said... ""only registered customers can use the computers okay?"" (Rudely) then I said ""well my fiance and I are staying. Shes like ""whats your room number"" (I got confused with my room number. I said 224 insead of 245 for some reason) she goes and looks it up and says ""yeah thats not your room"" so I was trying to remember my room number. She says ""why dont you go upstairs and have the person whos room its under and do it because only they can... because I dont want you to keep trying to guess your room number? Alright.?"" She said it in a rude but super fake nice way. Did NOT appreciate it. Didnt say anything back because I didnt want to be rude to her. SO later that night I went back and asked the guy if I could use the computer. He said ""yes you can"" he was nice and did not question me about it. So I have no idea what was up with the lady earlier that day. She had long black and this was on the 27th of this month (may) just incase if the hotel is actually reading this review. Other than that...my review would have been a four. But after her...im leaving it a three. 

Other than that..it was good. Breakfast was small but convinient because I get hungry right away in the morning so it was nice.

Didn't like so much, but was fine for the price you pay in Los Angeles.",BellasLey,2014-01-12

"We brought my two young children to California to take them to Disney. At one point they wanted to leave the park and come back to the hotel to swim :) The staff were so helpful and the rooms were clean though the bathroom was in need of updating. I still recommend this spot.

"Our one night stay was OK.  However, if you just WANT a king size bed you're OK, but if you NEED a king size bed, do not stop here.  The ""king"" is a queen, and I'm sure that means that the ""queen"" is a double.  It was frustrating.  We would not stay here again because of this.  Everything else was OK.  We did not stay for the continental breakfast.",bonnier305,2013-12-02
"My husband and I stayed in room 146 of the Newport Beach Travelodge, for an overnight stay.  We liked the small, friendly hotel at a reasonable price, clean, able to park very near our room, a microwave and refrigerator with several restaurants right across the street.
We had a problem with the light over the table turning itself off every few minutes.  We reported this when it became evident, after dark, but were told the maintenance crew had left by then.  
The continental breakfast was just the minimum essentials.  Adequate, but no nice muffins or rolls.
We will probably stay there again.",Toodletwo,2013-11-24
"In looking for nice and affordable lodging in Costa Mesa based on reviews by Trip Advisor, I chose this Travelodge and I'm glad I did. The rooms were excellent for the price. You get a flat screen TV, free wifi, a microwave and free breakfast. The pool was clean and inviting and the breakfast was fresh and there was a lot to choose from.

I would definitely stay here again. ",908gemmad,2013-11-19

"Our family of 4 stayed in this hotel to catch an early flight the next morning at Santa Ana Airport (5 minutes driving away). We arrived the previous day at 1 PM.
The employees were nice but could not arrange us on the first (ground) floor. Please note that there is no lift and if you have several pieces of luggage (as we did) you have to carry it for 2 flight of stairs. The room is very dated and not really clean. It did smell like smoke (we booked a non smoking room). There were only 3 sets of towels and a couple were stained. Everything looks old and needing of a renovation. Up to this point we thought it was still ok, considering the low price obtained through Expedia. 
What I really did not like is that it looks like many people really LIVE in this lodge... open doors showed cluttered rooms, group of men drinking alcohol and smoking... at the pool I could confirm this impression by the bizarre stories of a very talkative and annoying man who said he had a car accident, no insurance and challenged the other people involved to sue him as ""he had no money and lived in a motel"". Not really the place where you feel at ease and for the first time I did not leave my 12 y.o. daughter walking alone to the ice machine!",Paperausa,2013-07-26

However, back in December 2012 I had to stay there again for a long period of time and not only were the staff rude and messed up my billing and bank account but the rooms were also in horrible shape and in need of remodeling. At this Travelodge, the staff all from the GM, housekeeping, and front desk were kind, considerate, and knowledgeable. The rooms were clean and well kept. I felt safe as I was a single female staying by myself and the staff looked after me while I was there. The breakfast was SENSATIONAL and the pool and spa were resort style. Totally recommend!!!",Jennifer-saturdayG,2013-06-11
The room is very nice. Very pleased with everything. Staff is very friendly and helpful. Location is great.   Furniture is new and aesthetically pleasing.  I have no complaints.

We asked for another room and it took the front  desk girl 30 mins to let us know our choice was a smoking room upstairs which we did not want we asked for non smoking.

"Great location, convenient to the airport and downtown Newport Beach. The room was of decent size and nice amenities such as the fridge and microwave. The only thing that really turned us away was the smell of the room. We chose a ""non smoking"" room and one would have to wonder if it really was. It was hard to tell what the smell was but it sure didn't smell like it was a naturally clean scent or aroma. Either from a chemical or leftover smoke. Or perhaps smoke seeping in from other rooms. Other than that the room was decent and fit our needs with it's competitive price for the area.",PrestonK310,2013-04-20
"While the room was reasonably clean, there were so many issues with this room.  I think mostly it was in desperate need of a renovation.  The bed was really hard. The refrigerator made so much noise my husband unplugged it.  While the tub was a Jacuzzi tub, there was no plug.  My husband went to the front desk and they gave him a plug, but when he tried to run the Jacuzzi it only made a horrible loud noise, rattling the walls, but other than that, it didn't work!  The toilet paper holder was about 6 inches off the floor!  The hair dryer had been installed so that the cord is attached to the wall about 6 inches from the dryer, which makes it pretty difficult to dry your hair!  There was a wallpaper border that was missing in some areas, and nearly falling off in others.  There was only one electrical outlet available for use, and it was so loose that anything we tried to plug into it literally fell right out!  Outlets near the nightstands would be very helpful.  And last, but not least, the pillows on the bed were very tiny.  Sure could have used a few more.  

This hotel is in a great location, and the lobby is beautiful.  Perhaps they should spend some money on updating the rooms.  We would like to stay there again, only because it's so convenient for what we needed, but until they renovate the rooms, we'll have to stay at a location that's not quite as convenient as this one.",LaurelE_13,2013-04-11

"We booked 2 nights at this Travelodge.  Staff were friendly at arrival/check in time.  We reserved a room with two queen beds.

At the time of our check in, a ""suspicious"" looking woman (guest?) Interrupted our check in process by demanding a key to a room.  She was informed by the staff who checked their computer system that she ""was not requested"" in that room (!!!!). I think this should have been our clue to turn around and run as fast as possible, but it was late and we were very tired and nowhere else to go so we finished our check in.

Upon our.arrival in our non-smoking room, we encountered a room with worn out, filthy stained carpets.  Tried to open a night stand drawer and the front fell off! Bathroom light was covered with a thick fuzzy blanket of dirt/dust.  Chairs were badly stained with something black.  Couldn't sit on it, and definitely would advise against walking on the carpet barefoot!  The room reeked of.cigarette smell.  There was an old banana left in the microwave (by previous guest??), and to top it all off, an EMPTY condom wrapper Left behind in the trash can!!

As we had nowhere else to go and were exhausted after a long drive, we actually stayed and suffered through the night, trying to get some sleep while fighting our feelings of revulsion.

We complained the next morning to the, management, and to their credit, they refunded us both nites.  They were very apologetic.  We found another place to stay the second nite.

will NEVER book this place again!

"Stayed 8/9/12 Thurs eve. Felt as if we were a pain for the front desk clerk to work with except for running my credit card through for payment. Asked about the shuttle to the airport and were told it doesn't start until 6:30 am and had to be scheduled. Thankfully we had a rental car that I could hold for one more night and return or we would probably have missed our flight relying on this place for a shuttle. 

Got to our room, and we had one bath towel, and 2 washcloths for 3 people. When I called the front desk for additional towels, the phone rang and rang, finally the clerk picked up and I was told to ""come down and get them."" I asked why and was told that there was ""no one here tonight to bring them to the room."" When I got to the front desk there was the front desk clerk and one other staff member; both went to a back room to get the towels. I don't like being lied to.

When we had checked in I asked if it was automatic check-out and I was told I had to come to the front desk in the morning. When I arrived in the morning at 5:30 am, no one was at the front desk, I called out twice ""hello, "" no surprises there, so I grabbed a piece of paper from the printer and wrote a note that we were checking out. The same clerk came out from the back rubbing his eyes.  I said we're checking out is there anything for me to sign, he said ""no."" Big waste of my time coming to the front desk to deal with this guy for the last time. 

As for the room, ok on cleanliness. Doors open to the outside, air conditioner is a window mount, very noisy and not very cold air. Refrigerator worked well. Stain on the blanket--when I saw that automatically pulled the bed apart to check for bugs. There was a carpet tack on the floor which I stepped on. The bathroom had a toilet roll dispenser about 5 inches from the floor, that seemed like a creative construction trick to say the least. The bathtub drained backwards into the tub rather than into the drain. Bottom of shower curtain had mold. 

Basically stayed here because it was going to be a short night. I wouldn't recommend on spending more than one night here. It is ""bare-bones"" --that's it. 

Parking lot fills up fast, nothing on one side where most of the hotel is (behind the pool). 

I really can't believe that these hotels/motels don't have standards from one hotel to the next (eg in order to get the Travelodge designation you have to meet standard requirements). The decorative ""lighting"" in the front windows is more tacky than welcoming.",Bluestater,2012-08-12
"I've stayed here five times now. The experience is consistent: the Travelodge Orange County Airport delivers a decent room for a very low price. You're plenty close to the beach area, John Wayne Airport, and a nexus of freeways that will take you anywhere in the greater LA-Orange County area. The decor and furnishings are aging, but they're aging gracefully :). And again, I feel as if I got at least what I paid for when it comes to hot water, a comfortable bed, a decent cable lineup, and very convenient free parking and Internet. The in-room microwave and fridge are all I really need. The blackout curtains made my room utterly dark and restful. You don't hear the jets from the airport between about 9 p.m. and 8 a.m., because of local regulations. There's a small but decently equipped exercise room. You're easy walking distance from restaurants, both fast-food and casual dining, and there are two convenience stores right across the street. When it's time for a remodeling, I'm sure they'll put in some more stylin' bedding and fixtures, but in the meantime, it's still a great place to lay your head at night. Take the money you save by staying here and splurge at South Coast Plaza, The Camp, or the legendary Hi-Time Wine Cellars in nearby Newport Beach.",spiderdad,2012-02-28
"They offer free shuttle to and from airport, as well as to the Amen Clinic! Our check in & check out was fast, efficient and no billing errors. I was in room 125 in the back, no noise & hotel is conveniently located. Our room was clean, all amenities in the room functioned properly (fridge, microwave, tv, blowdryer, coffee maker) . Beds were comfortable, rooms smelled clean and the a/c - heater worked, we tried both. It's not a five star hotel, but for a night or 3 night stay in  my case, I feel it was well worth it; I got a good deal on the internet. The grounds were immaculate and beautiful & they also have a car rental in the lobby! The only complaint I have is the art work in the room was outdated, but it appears they are updating all of the rooms as a couple of rooms down from mine was completely gutted and being remodeled. The continental breakfast consisted of juice, milk, coffee, bagels, english muffins, fresh fruit and cereal; enough to get your day started. It was served in 2 adjacent rooms which provided numerous tables to sit at with a flat screen to watch the news.   The pool was medium size, it looked clean and the hot tub was definitely hot; it also looked clean. There was a nice grill in the pool area also.  All of the staff I had contact with were very friendly and willing to help. I think they have made many changes over the last couple of years.",debbieD713,2012-02-03
"Actually felt like I blew it. I had other choices on my I-phone at about the same price. I just happened by here and wanted to get the room rental out of the way, Probably should have waited. Room was sufficient for a quick overnight stay.",Wingtipsmith,2011-09-26
"I was flying in with kids 8, 5 and 16 months, and arriving late (10:45 PM).  We were renting a van at the airport the next day to drive down to Carlsbad (for Legoland), and just needed a place close the airport for the overnight.  I limited my search to hotels that had free airport shuttle.  When I arrived I called for the shuttle.  They said ""we don't have a shuttle.""  After stating that thier site said they do, he said they don't have one ""at this time of night.""  They offered to comp me cab fare.  This is what we did.  When I arrived, I pressed him a bit, and it turns out that thier shuttle drivers is ""on vacation.""  That seems a little lame.  They did, however, also comp the taxi back to the airport to pick up my rental.
The room was fine.  A little dingy, but for ""cheap near the airport,"" you have to kind of expect that.
If I fly in like this again (unlikely), I would probably stay there again, but I would verify the shuttle before hand.",jthoni,2011-04-25
"I booked this hotel, I confess, because it was the cheapest place I could find in all of south-central Orange County. I wasn't expecting much, so I was delighted to find it quiet, scrupulously clean, and equipped with all the things I want: free Internet (why do ""premium"" hotels feel they can charge for this? Internet is Internet), free parking (see previous comment), a nice fridge to store supplies for the room picnics I enjoy, a good TV with a well-above-average cable lineup, a comfortable bed, effective heat and A/C, and plenty of hot water in the shower. For a hotel this inexpensive, any kind of breakfast would be a bonus, so I wasn't disappointed at the modest offerings in the breakfast room. They saved even a few more bucks, so who can complain? I didn't even have to buy a newspaper -- they were in the lobby. I disagree with a previous commenter who thought the furnishings were gauche -- they were just motel basic, not raggedy and kitschy, just unremarkable. It's close to the airport, but I heard only a few flights taking off, partly because the takeoffs were angled away from the motel, and partly because OC is zealous about not allowing taking-off jets to be noisy. They have to throttle back after taking off, and they don't fly late at night or early in the morning. This stretch of Bristol is bland, but only a few miles up the road are South Coast Plaza, one of the highest-grossing and fanciest malls in the country (nearby are theaters, music venues as well). Even closer is a pair of ""anti-malls"" that any younger person would find delightful; these are shops selling handmade crafts, organic and quirky food, amazing bicycles, cool outdoorsy wear, and more (one of these malls is called ""The Camp,"" and it looks like a permanent village set up by the world's smartest hippies. The other, across a busy street, is called ""The Lab,"" with similar goodies plus performance possibilities).

Anyway, you could do much, much worse, and you probably have, if you prowl for cheap rooms the way I do. This Travelodge was well worth it for the budget travelers.",spiderdad,2011-01-31
"This hotel was such a steal!

$68.70/night for a king sized comfortable bed (Run Of The House Rate on reservation) with a 42"" LCD plasma screen tv (HDMI compatible for gaming and laptop), continental breakfast, and was only 2 miles away from food and the party we were crashing.

If you're rainbow friendly; the Tin Lizzie Saloon is around the corner and it's always gay night every night.

The room was so large roomy and comfortable we felt at home straight off the bat.I was here with my girlfriend and she was so impressed and so happy that this place turned out pretty awesome!
It's real close to the John Wayne Airport; has a laundromat; pool & jacuzzi (did not go swimming so I wouldn't know), and also exercise room.

Only gripe was that the internet was slow but it was available, the fact that the parking was only so-so, our room was right next to sewage (gross but did not stink so long as we were in the room), and the cleaning ladies were waiting on us to get out stuff out and check out. The front desk people are awesome!

Continental Breakfast:
Assorted Bagels, cereal, oatmeal, english muffins, apples, oranges, and bananas.
Drinks: OJ, apple juice, tea, coffee and milk.

Bathtub had a crack but it was obviously repaired in the past.

The best part was that when you book on a weekday you get 20% off discount on each night so if you book a stay for a Monday - Friday weekday. (includes weekends if you book with weekday stay)

Check in was at 3pm however if you're going to check in later leave it in Customer Comments; checkout was at noon.",wy_ly2856,2011-01-23
"I was really excited to take my boyfriend and three teenagers on this trip -- a family wedding with some tourist activity tacked on.  We had taken an early flight, spent half the day at Universal Studios, then sought the hotel for some rest before the wedding, shower, etc. Unfortunately Google map directions were way wrong [not sure whose fault that is ...]  so it took a good 30 minutes more to find it, even with an active GPS too.

When we checked in, the clerk was extremely friendly, but we were met with the AWFUL news that the pool and spa were out of service for maintenance. Surely between Priceline and the hotel there would be some way to notify a leisure traveler?  Anyway, let's not blame the hotel.

The rooms were decorated in the most eye-searing fabrics -- bedspreads, curtains, oy vey! Who was thinking what? But both rooms appeared very clean, and we liked the large vanity /countertop for the sink. Microwave and fridge? Two thumbs up! An ice-caked freezer in which you couldn't actually fit anything? Thumbs down. Clean tub & shower? Thumbs up. No fan in the bathroom? Thumbs down.

There was no 'privacy' door hanger, then it was an unpleasant surprise the next morning when housekeeping came knocking at 9. We asked them to come back at 11, then filtered downstairs for the ""premium"" continental breakfast. NOTHING premium -- boxed cereals, bagels, no recycling, and the threat of being interrogated about your room before you could eat. Fortunately that showdown never came to pass.

Saturday was a fun day, full day at Universal Studios, general exploring. We came back after dinner with the intent of hanging out & relaxing. One grumpy guy [perhaps a long-time guest/resident] told my girls to be quiet -- they were giggling when knocking on the door of the room my son was staying in. It was 10 PM, and they were a couple of giggling teenagers. CHILL, mister.

Sunday dawned brightly over the empty pool and jacuzzi :-( and as we were preparing to pack the car and checkout there was a cluster of 5 young men in the breezeway near one of our rooms. The aroma of illegal herbs was strong as I came around the corner to take the stairs down.  Eventually we had to call hotel staff to have them removed. This is unfortunate and was uncomfortable because there were plenty of housekeepers rolling their carts back and forth so they should have seen.

At check out, again the service was really great. Thanks for the mint!

Air noise from the county airport wasn't too bad, access to freeway was decent, so all in all I'll give it a thumbs up ... with an asterisk.  Good luck to you!",loraf301,2010-10-28
"It was easy to get there from John Wayne(OC) Airport, especially making use of the complimentary shuttle. I have even visited before from LAX - self-drive, and the hotel is situated centrally in the heart of OC. It has a welcoming exterior, simple, in keeping with Travelodge, but cared for and tended.
I was greeted in the lobby with pleasant efficiency and nothing was too much trouble. This would probably be the perfect hub for business trips too. But I was on holiday. Walking passed the pools to my room, the water looked clean and inviting.

My room was ambient; someone had designed it 'home-from-home', it seemed just for me, and the message read that if anything was lacking they would do their utmost to rectify it. I found nothing however was lacking: It was perfectly comfortable (dare I say upmarket for a Travelodge) - I was quite taken aback by the thoughtful attention to detail and amenities, and I felt safe. 
The breakfast was simple and well considered. Not just a pile of donuts, but fresh juice and fruit, coffee, cereals and breads and English muffins to toast.
At night I could walk a few yards to a choice of lively local eateries, or take a short drive to the bustling bars and bistros on Newport Coast. 
The hotel is convenient for the classy shopping malls, (Spectrum, Fashion Island and South Coast Plaza) and a couple of trendy, funky 'anti-malls' are really close by...worth a look! 

There are beautiful Soca golf courses - one backing onto the hotel, - and all manner of visitor attractions locally, including Disneyland and Universal. I had easy access to the freeways, South to San Diego, East to the Coacella Valley Desert, North to downtown LA, or a short hop West to the glorious coastal villages which cater for chic and surf alike!

Now don't get me wrong, - we are not looking at the elite, top-notch, dollar-guzzling end of the market; - this is not a five star, plush, marbled, palace...but it certainly aspires to be one, and should have five stars for effort! So for comfort, care, cleanliness, convenience and considerable value I would award this particular unique Travelodge an A+ *.",SussexVoyager2,2010-03-17
"I travel frequently and have had the opportunity to stay in several hotels.  The location is perfect when flying into John Wayne, this hotel has it all.  Friendly staff, clean quiet rooms,
shuttle service, business center, continental breakfast.  What more could you ask for?  Superb value.",3_EaglesYorbaLinda,2009-11-17
"This is an excellent hotel, very good located, close to the OC Santa 
Ana Airport John Wayne (3 minutes by car, only), better that LAX Aiport. If you are travelling to the south of California or going to Disneyland... excellent hotel and excellent location. It has a reasonable price and a good breakfast. Close, you can find 
restaurants, etc. Moreover, there are several ""latinos"" working, so, if you do not speak 
English they can help you. I go there from Madrid (Spain)",Spain_Madrid_Europe,2009-05-29
"This is very nice, average motel, near Newport Beach, and Disneyland. The rooms were clean, and each had a fridge and a microwave. The a/c unit has a ""fan only"" option, so we turned that on at night, for white noise, and we didn't hear a single thing from outside or the rooms around us. The breakfast was free, standard fare: cold cereal, bagels, fruit. 
The front desk staff was very friendly; we had to change our reservation dates at the last minute, and they were very accomadating. 
We never used the pool, but we went by it, and it was large, appeared very clean and private.
Overall, for the price, it's a great deal. It's not fancy, but it's kept up, good location, and a perfect ""home base"" if you are planning to do a lot of site seeing, and need a place to come rest and regroup. I will absolutely be staying again next summer.
The ONE thing I would caution: make sure to use mapquest., as the maps make it look like it is right off the freeway, but it is actually kind of tricky to get to, if you don't know your way around the town, which we didn't.

"The absolute most disgusting hotel I have ever stayed at.  Bed was full of bedbugs, some big, some small, jumping all over the place.  The proprietors and Travelodge should be ashamed of themselves.  A rotten, flea bitten (literally) dump.  Sleep in your car if you have to but don't stay here.",JayColorado,2007-01-03
