"A genuinely Budget friendly Hotel and exceptional employees , clean and older decors in room and suites.
However they are currently remolding spa and swimming pool , area .
When you enter the lobby area ,you may hear some  really nice Jazz music  and a fireplace  and a feel of positive energy and relaxation as you go through the check in process.
Ms. R and the rest of her working professionals are genuinely pleasant and the Cleaning staff and Maintenance personnel are hard workers day in and day out.

This is the worst hotel you would ever try going to this hotel is nasty and especially they don’t even offer refunds I didn’t even go to the hotel and couldn’t get a refund back I waited 3 weeks for nothing this hotel is literally the bottom of the barrel when it comes to finding places would not recommend to anyone don’t book here and if you do and try to get your refund back good luck,Lam2swae,2022-11-06
"I like to start with a positive - great location near the freeway and SNA airport.  
That is it.  This is the only reason I gave ANY stars.

I am going to directly address issues from Quality Inn's ""Your Satisfaction"" card that was on our table in the room.   I brought the card home with me.

Commitment to your satisfaction - Any issue was completely ignored or unaddressed.
I asked for a washcloth to be delivered to the room - never arrived.  
They make nothing right.

Commitment to clean - Filthy place, including dog feces on the property, stacks of beer cans/trash, disgusting ""spa,"" piles of dirt in carpet corners, and the list goes on.
Even the elevators were terrible.  You would need a prescription of antibiotics prior to go in to the pool.  Threadbare dingy linens.

Forgot something?  ""...Ask front desk and we'll be glad to help..."" 
I asked for a plastic fork, a fresh towel (sorry they are all dirty), etc.  

Room to be Green - Linens replaced every third day unless you ask?  Hello?  No one told me this upon check-in.  In three days we never had one single housekeeping thing done.  I wouldn't trust that anyway.

Bed - Hard as a rock 

Breakfast  - And I quote DIRECTLY from their room card...""Start your day right with a complimentary hot, fresh and health breakfast.""  UHHH...not even WATER was available in the lobby.  ""GO TO MCDONALD'S"" is what I was told for coffee or food, as all they had was an old pastry in a grab and go bag.  

Service - Horrid.  Rude and ignorant people.  

Essentials - And AGAIN I quote....""Get the value you deserve with free Wifi (DID NOT WORK), newspaper (NONE), tea and coffee""...one lousy pack..However, there is an in-room fridge.  That was actually true!  

I complained upon check-out, and was told ""sorry"" and ""I will tell the manager"" who was of course not there when I asked to see him or her.  

This is an outrage.  I truly feel this hotel is one of  those freebies to addicts/homeless also.  Lots of sketchy men hanging around at night.  

I intend to take this issue to higher levels.  I want nothing but to warn the general public to stay away.  I would never enter a ""Quality Inn"" anywhere again on this planet.",H354BPkimberlys,2022-08-29
"Poorly maintained, dirty, I would not stay here again.   Unless I was looking for a Hooker. Pool was green  with algae,.  So was the 'spa'.  No thumbs up.    I booked with hotels.com. Disappointed.  No house keeping unless you ask prior day. No breakfast.  Probably just as well.   There is a McDonald's next door.",robertnH2199NP,2022-07-04
"I had damage done to my car by another guest who tossed a burning cigarette from there 3rd floor balcony and landing on  the roof of my car  and left a big brown spot . Most of it buffed off but there is still a very small spot burn in the paint.  Still it should not have happen .  Did report and did have a desk clerk look at before I left and still 
 I have not heard back from a manger . 5 days now . Does anyone care at this hotel ?  Wonder if they would care if that burning cigarette would have landed in the dry flower bed and started the hotel on fire and guests got hurt ??  I would not have expected this from a $125.00 night Hotel. I did contact Choice hotels.",642richarde,2022-05-23
"It’s basic basic but does the job for a 1 night stay. Nice to have a small Chinese food restaurant attached but you can walk to several other options. Pool yes, but hot tub, no! The free breakfast was “grab and go”, so basically a few things to microwave and a bottle of water. 
Book via a travel site (vs their web site) and save $20, but you won’t get points for your stay.

"OK first thing when I arrived I knew it was bad. The parking garage was filled with homeless people, drug dealers, etc. The door into the hotel had a sign that read ""please use room key to unlock"" but there was not a lock on the door it looks like it had been stolen and the door opened without a room key needed. I walked through what looked like a hallway out of a horror movie with trash cracked tiles and flickering lights to the elevator. While I was checking in the woman working the front desk said probably no more than 5 words to me. I asked about the price match policy that was on the website and she said they don't do it. When I got to my room it was clearly dirty, like instead of changing the sheets the housekeepers just made the bed. All the furniture looks like it has been there since the 70s, scratches everywhere, and visibly disgusting. The fridge and microwave were the oldest appliances that I have ever seen, they could not have been less than 30 years old. The next thing I notice is that the lock on the door to the room seemed to not be working. I called Quality Inn customer service to report how gross the room was. While on the phone with customer service I get a call on the phone in the room from the front desk and they tell me I have 5 minutes to get out of the hotel. I go to the front desk to talk this over and be moved to a clean room and the manager Linda starts screaming at me telling me to leave accusing me of lying about the state of the room. I asked if I would get all my money back if I left and she said: ""I don't know"". At that point, I knew if I left I would not get my money back. Linda continues to scream and verbally abuse me to the point where I start crying, Linda then instructs me to sit in the lobby and wait. I sit in the lobby crying for almost an hour with no word from anyone. Linda then returns and shows me some other rooms she called VIP rooms. They were identical to the first room. I accept one because there wasn't availability at any other hotels and I was exhausted. Looking back on this stay I honestly think it may have been a better idea to have slept in my car. I kept a list of every problem I had during my stay:
- BUGS EVERYWHERE bathroom, public areas, even in the beds!
-The door onto the balcony DOES NOT LOCK! huge security concern especially with dozens of homeless people in the parking lot
- THE WATER IS BROWN it is obviously unsafe to drink, and they do not provide clean drinking water
- cracks in the walls and tiles
-paint peeling and popcorn ceiling falling off
suspicious stains EVERYWHERE what looked like blood stains on the curtains and poop stains in the carpet
-The key cards stop working if they are near a cell phone, so don't keep it in your purse or pocket
-The ""breakfast"" looks like something they would give you in a public elementary school. inedible microwave burritos and stale raisin snails
- The newspapers in the lobby are extremely right-biased, some of the articles contained straight up lies. 
-The pool breakfast and fitness room are closed even though every other hotel I have seen is open. 

And finally the worst part of my stay, after I checked out and had gotten home I checked my bank account. THEY OVERCHARGED ME BY 100 DOLLARS. I have spent the last 3 days emailing and calling the hotel and corporate and they have done nothing for me. Looking at other reviews and BBB complaints it looks like I am not the only guest they do this to. my guess is they overcharge every guest and just hope you do not notice. THIS PLACE NEEDS TO BE SHUT DOWN",phoebsss,2021-06-23
The property is poorly managed.  Avoid at all costs! There were so many problems with this hotel: 1. The older gentleman who checked us in had his mask pulled down to his chin (not covering his mouth or nose) and was constantly coughing. 2. The hotel room had a quarter of a roll of toilet paper in the bathroom. No spare roll. We had to go to front desk to get another roll. 3. The microwave didn’t work. 4. The bathroom faucet leaked a steady stream of water non-stop. Not a trickle but a stream! 5. I am disabled and asked for a room on the main floor in advance but we were given a room on top floor as far away from the lobby as possible. 6. To top it all off: the phone in our room rang at 4:15am. No more sleep for me that night.,LolaHonolulu,2021-06-15
"•	Found two cockroaches in the bathroom during the night. 
•	The non-smoking room smelled like cigarettes. 
•	It looked as though someone threw up from one of the balconies around the pool.  We got there on Friday and it was still not cleaned up when we left on Sunday morning.
•	The “Breakfast” was a breakfast burrito, (the kind that are 3/$1.00), water and a pre-wrapped Danish.
•	The carpet needed cleaning.
•	We could not turn off the water in the bath / shower.
•	The couch had holes and stains.  
•	The furniture was so dirty; I was scared to sit anywhere.",Q5870RXgregm,2021-06-06
"The hotel is not well maintained and I was first greeted by a cranky man who works the overnight shift. I paid an extra $30. to check in early. My room was older, furniture quite beat up, very thin towels, rust around the drains. Then, heard pipes roar and feces started to fill the tub. A pipe burst. I called the front desk and the phone just rings. Then, I get dressed to go to the front and pass a man complaining about the broken ice machine and overflowing lobby trash cans. I return to make coffee in my room and the coffee maker had some crusty food stuffed where the water belongs. 
I have to pack up switch rooms for a non-feces room with clean plumbing, shower. 
The next room looked better except for the paint peeling off the wall and candy wrappers by the nightstand- no idea how housekeeping missed them! 
Breakfast is a frozen Costco breakfast sandwich with a bottle of water.
The manager says I'll be refunded one night, instead, I'm billed for an additional night which I wasn't there for!  After a $100 deposit, and a couple hundred taken off my card that won't be refunded until they process a refund correctly, not charge me for a refund?? And For their error, I was inconvenienced greatly -I am editing a lot because I think I've made my point. This hotel you are always dealing with a rude staff who are unsophisticated, zero customer service, or any care for their job. With a DND sign on your door, they will pound on your door and literally shrug saying ""oh...' 

The worst part, I'm having to go without nearly $400. for many days of my money while their bank processes a refund for funds not authorized to spend! The worst l hotel I've experienced in OC which is a shame because their corporate is so professional and Choice hotel group otherwise seems like a decent brand for basic, clean, average stays.",253jennifery,2021-04-06

"I was looking for a two-night stay in a clean, safe, comfortable, quiet and reasonably priced location near Mission Viejo. I only stayed one night. My room was unmade when I checked in and had to request another room. I have a UV flashlight, and the bed linens and pillows were spotless. Aside from stains on the walls and a dirty towel on the floor in the bathroom, the room was clean. There was no noise from adjoining rooms, but the generator on the outside balcony ran continuously with no way to turn it off. I found the bed mattress to be very hard: my back and both hips were sore and I could not sleep—the primary reason I checked out a day early. I always felt safe, staff were pleasant and helpful, and the room was fairly priced. The breakfast was very good. As other reviewers have stated, the rooms are dated and in dire need of remodeling if management aspires to be more than a two-star hotel. Hard mattress and noisy generators were a huge down-side for me.",dr_cherylc808,2019-08-15

"We had a last minute venue change and had to make a last minute hotel switch. There was only one desk clerk at 3:00 pm when we checked in. So things were slow. The room frankly has seen better days. The nightstand was being propped up by a wooden block and the drawer would not close. One of the drawers on the cabinet looked like it was going to fall off. The real problem came Saturday morning when we awoke to the sound of water running. There was water leaking from the ceiling of our bathroom. When I alerted the front desk they said maintenance would be in after 9:00 am. This was at 7:30 am. The clerk could of cared less and told me management was not available.. So we got dressed and left for our event but packed our bags in case we needed to move. We came back late Saturday night to discover that the water stopped leaking but there were pieces of ceiling in the tub and the wall was wet. So I don't believe anything was done. When I asked the desk , I was met with a blank stair and once again told the maintenence was not available. We gave up and went to bed. We tried one last time on Sunday morning to talk to management and were once again told no one is available. Please spend your money elsewhere. The owners really no not care about their guests.

"I had a reservation for this place last week it was unfortunate when I came in to register the manager Penny Fleming was sitting down at the desk( I thought it was unusual for someone to be siting down) she made no eye contact with me and didn't even say hello.  This rude horrible manager was so disrespectful to me that she just wanted to argue about everything.
Why is a manager sitting behind a check in desk and not managing her motel.
What ever you do please try not to check in to this place before check in at 3pm or you will be rebranded by the manager.
I asked her several times if my room was ready it was 11:15 am and she told me over and over again that check in was at 3pm. She never did respond to my question, she just wanted to pick a fight.
I have stayed in numerous choice hotels throughout the years and never has a problem checking in before 3 pm until I came to this rude manager.
After arguing with me for about 5 minutes she then says she can check me in at noon for additional $10.00.  Why didn't she just tell me that 5 minutes before instead of reprimanding about the check in time.  
She then decided to cancel my reservation and told me I would be happier some where else. 
I told her she was rude and I would be reporting her, she said you go right ahead.

Penny Fleming (Manager)  obviously has no prior management experience in a hotel motel setting, she has no customer service skills and definitely is not out to help her guests.",499debbiel,2018-10-28
"I gave this place 3 stars last time I stayed - now it gets one.
The neighborhood is sketchy believe it or not. I pulled up and two homeless people were hanging out in front. 
The front staff barely made eye contact. The manager walked through the lobby barefoot.
The place needs a makeover BADLY. The ceiling tiles are stained and falling down at the front desk area. The entire place is being held together by a string ! One good California earthquake and it’s all going down. 
Super noisy. I was awakened on a Sunday morning at 5:30am by my upstairs neighbor taking a shower. The pipes in my bathroom sounded like they were ready to explode. 
It’s affordable - that’s it. It’s too bad because I’ve stayed at lots of other locations and they have been pretty nice.

"The sofa bed in the room did not have a sofa bed mattress but a thin layer of foam.  The area beneath the head of the mattress area was dirty and had rotting food and drink container lids.  The sofa bed sagged and was broken in the middle.  We approached the front desk and asked for assistance to fix the sofa bed and they told us no one is available until the morning so we asked for an alternate room for one night until they could get someone in or a different mattress so our son would have a place to sleep.  The staff told us there was a room available at 4x the original cost we paid for our original room and no other rooms were available.  So we found another hotel that night so our son had a bed to sleep in.  The following morning I spoke to the manager on the phone asking for one night credit (we had three nights booked), and she told me that no one came down to the front desk complaining about a mattress and she called me 30 minutes later telling me the sofa wasn't broken.  I was throughly disappointed by the management of this location.  No one was willing to help us and essentially called us liars about the condition of the sofa bed and wanted to charge us 4x the normally daily rate for one night until they could fix the sofa bed the next day.

"We've stayed at several Choice Hotel properties in the past, with good service and value.  This hotel is not as nice as any of the others in the brand.  
We looked at this hotel prior to our stay and were shown a nice ""renovated"" room.  When reserving on-line, we requested a ""renovated"" room for 2 people.  Got a room with a broken front door handle, with peeling paint, mold in the shower, rusty shower fixtures, stained carpeting, 2 bath towels and 1 set of very small toiletries.  Asked for extra towels and another shampoo/conditioner; was told we had to wait until morning.  Walkway to the room had safety cones placed around broken, unglued floor tiles that moved.  Breakfast items were very sparse; the scrambled eggs weren't real and the sausages looked pretty bad.  Breakfast cabinet doors were padlocked, which really makes a guest worry about safety/theft in the hotel overall.  Our room had no soundproofing; we could hear everything from next door and the hallway.  We were told when checking out, since we were leaving early, we couldn't be checked out or receive the final bill as reservation was made on-line.  And that a general manager had to OK our bill since we booked on-line, and she wasn't in for awhile.  We've traveled for over 30 years in many hotels in the US and overseas; and have never been told we couldn't be checked out of a hotel.  Very disappointing stay.",L2873NEhollym,2017-11-13
"From the start almost to the finish, our stay here was stellar. Diego at the front desk was very welcoming and cordial during checkin. The hotel lobby and breakfast area are quite large, nicely appointed and very inviting. The room was very nice, absolutely spotless, the bed, in fact the entire room and the lobby appear to have been updated recently. The room was very spacious, in fact, large enough for a sleeper sofa that looked like it would make into a second king size bed. 
The room included a small balcony overlooking the street below. 
The flat screen tv was very nice and functioned flawlessly. 
The refrigerator was standard issue for a motel room, or a small apartment! 
We did not have enough time to experience the swimming pool, or a jacuzzi that we spotted on the ground floor. 
The hotel also has an Oriental Restaurant on site, but, alas, we did not have occasion to experience the restaurant. 
The only reason I didn't give this hotel a 5 was breakfast. The omelet was okay, the sausages were good, but the banner ad in the lobby lead me to believe there would be  a hot waffle available.... wrong. They do have a pancake making machine, but it was very disappointing. Each push of button yielded two thin, pancakes smaller than the palm of my hand. The pancakes were rubbery and difficult to cut with the plastic cutlery provided. There were other options, bagles, bread, etc. some fruit, plenty of juice and coffee; but I'm a fan of a well made waffle and really had my tastebuds ready for  a crisp golden brown waffle. Bummer dude!

"My first image impression of this hotel was that it's one of the nicest looking hotel.  When we arrived, our room wasn't even ready.  The bed was not made and I had to call for the maid. However, the office desk was clean and professional looking. I was disappointed in the shower drain.  I pulled out a bunch of long hair, meaning it wasn't removed. Breakfast was ok.  The pop out pancakes on demand was not as good as a typical waffle maker.  The bagel was quite stale.  Not a lot of selection.  The worst part was when my husband was told that he needed to clear out the pool by 10:00 pm. He did not appreciate their poor customer service and advised me to put in his peace of mind on this review. The front desk misinformed me by saying there's no fitness room, but there was one downstairs with a puddle in front.  The spa and bar has been closed.

"Well this,experience has been the example of the WORST customer service I have been put through in my 15 years as a fitness professional who travels the nation teaching large gym chain staffs the importance of customer service and going the extra mile for the member or guest.

It started earlier in the afternoon when the General Manager, Peggy Fleming was RUDE to a fault, put me on hold multiple times for over 5 minutes, hung up on me, didn't answer the phone when I tried calling back for over 30 minutes only to finally answer and put me on hold again. 

I was calling to confirm my reservation I put on my boss's company card and to make sure that I would not need the card or a waiver to use it again for any other charges that were not explained to me because the GM wouldn't talk to me.

When I arrived after driving 3 hours from San Diego where I live the evening receptionist Fadi explained to me that I needed a credit card for a deposit after seeing him tell the previous guests in front of me that he ""could sneak them in and to not tell his manager Penny."" Unfortunately since I didn't know this information, did not have the card on me, and was not allowed to use the card that my boss left on file because it had to be physically there or some sort of waiver signed.

Responsible for managing the Hotel's management team (HOD's) and overall hotel procedures (and here's the best part..) and TARGETS TO DELIVER AN EXCELLENT GUEST EXPERIENCE.

E P I C    F A I L !

I had to call another general manager from another one of my gyms who came down and was able to do that for me which I'm extremely grateful for. When she asked Fadi why he was giving such extremely poor, aggressively degrading, and confrontational customer service that she was receiving from him, he became very angry and started yelling at her saying that he can sneak anybody in he wants, he can do what he wants, if he wants to check people in early he can do that and that's it's none of her business. At this point there was a line behind us and the people were in shock for how he was treating her. I don't know if it was his ethnicity, being Middle Eastern, and how he is used to treating women, but it was extremely degrading and not something I can tolerate.

I mean did I just wake up today in the wrong dimension or something because since when are guests of a hotel, or any type of customer at any business treated in this fashion?

I am the District Manager for one of the largest gym chains in the United States and I've never seen this kind of belligerent, hostile, and combative customer service by anyone that I saw these two representatives of Choice Hotels give me and someone who came to help me for their error in my 15 years of experience in the fitness industry. I am appalled by both these individuals, 

If a customer service or guest relations representative from Choice Hotels or Quality Inn Suites doesn't contact me and explain why I deserved to go through this ordeal and treatment and don't fix it, I will go to the corporate offices of each, or as high as I need to, and I will take this up with them and I will make sure that this review gets put on each hotel search engine site and any other hotel and hospitality site, including social media, and expose this type of treatment to your guests by Penny Fleming and Fadi and shared with thousands.

Unbelievable. Stay away.",Chiali75,2017-09-02
"We got there about 10:55pm on a Saturday evening.
Room seemed clean, except for what it seemed a dead mosquito squashed on a bathroom wall.
Beds were really comfortable

Now for the negative stuff:
- We first had to wait in line to get checked in for about 20 minutes.
- We also noticed a lot of spills on the lobby as well as the dining room area.
- The A/C had a weird noise when it when on during the night. Thankfully, my husband and I wear ear plugs so it wasn’t an issue.
- The breakfast setup is not enough for the large crowd on Sunday morning when we got there around 8:30am:
- No eggs
- Only a few slices of white bread
- No decaf
- No coffee
- No tea
- No fruit
- Somebody made the comment they were there around 7am and there was no food then either

My observations:
- The bacon and egg trays are way too small for the large crowd.
- The attendant was gone for long times to get replenishment.
- By the time she replenished the coffee, left to replenish the bread, the coffee was out again.
- A gallon of milk was left on the attendant’s counter. I think it should have been refrigerated.
- Though she finally replenished the bread tray, there was no wheat bread available.
- Perhaps the replenishment of non-cooked goods could be improved by having the products closer to the attendant: breads, fruit, coffee, etc.
- There should be larger trays of bacon and egg available so the food runs out less often, and have it replaced at determined times even if the tray is not empty. Then we don’t run out of food.
- There should be more coffee dispensers.
- And perhaps for the large Sunday crowd, have 2 attendants.

We were glad we were only staying one night!",amk900,2017-08-14
"Bottom line: comfy, nice accommodations, good breakfast, will go again if the need arrises. 
Shocked by hotel sticker shock in the region, we happened upon this one and decided to book it. At this point we were wanting to get as close to our business mtg. as we could and didn't want to have to make a long drive in the middle of morning rush hour. It was a port in a storm. What was surprising was how nice the staff was, quick check in, but did not like that they wanted to copy my driver's license. Illegal in CA. We declined and explained the law and that they could not do it. Verification is one thing but they can't go beyond that. They gave us a very nice room but it was very hot and it took the a.c. a while to cool it down. The bed was comfy, bathroom was clean and the long counter at the sink was very nice for getting organised. The room was clean and comfy. Breakfast was very good. The pancakes were tasty. The morning desk guy would not let me get my paperwork until the time of actual check out. First time I ever experienced that. Not a big deal, but would have preferred to get a copy of the paperwork, load up the car, and drop off the key. It's not that important and we were pleased with the good service and accommodations as mentioned. Will go back for sure in the future.",johntrak,2017-07-22
"When I checked into my room there was a small but adequate desk.  There was no chair to use at the desk.  I guess you did not intend for the desk to be used, because there was no bulb in the desk lamp.  That is really unacceptable.  The room was not ready for guests.  Somebody doesn't care.  I got the chair and the light bulb, but I should not have had to ask.

Next, what's up with only 15 channels on the TV?  I have the cheapest plan at home and have 3 times as many channels.  No cable here?  No movie channels?  No kid friendly channels?  Pretty lame!
I have stayed here a few times, but not again, given the choice of other hotels near here",stu3art,2017-07-11
"We had a bad experience at another hotel and got to this hotel and got into our online room booked quickly. The staff was very pleasant and accommodating. This is not the fanciest hotel but in a good location for food choices and fun. The breakfast is simple with eggs and sausage or bacon in the warmer, pancake maker, toast, bagels, donuts or muffins depending on the day, yogurt, fruit or cereal options. We were satisfied with our stay. ",366sierrat,2017-07-08
"Checked in late evening. Easy to find. Lots of food choices around and there's a Chinese restaurant attached. Free wifi, free parking, free breakfast, free friendly staff. I think I was helped by Penny. The nice lady friend Sydney Australia. At first my key didn't work. I tried a few times then she escorted me to my room to make sure I got in. Awesome customer service. There's a pool to cool off in this summer heat. Opened the door and wow was I surprised. I was expecting low budget sketchy room with things broken down.  Not at all. It's a lot better then a lot of other hotel rooms I've stayed at. Reminds me of a casino hotel room. Marble bathroom countertops, a sofa, large fridge with freezer. Nice wide table with comfy office chair. Nice lighting and aircon. Coffee with green recycle cups. Way to go! Ice bucket with toiletries. Clean wide bed and flat screen. I wish I was staying longer so I can enjoy my room longer. Totally staying here again. It's perfect.  There's a Mc. Donald's just yards away right by the pool. Scored an awesome suite",Jetset18MelM,2017-07-08
"As a business owner this was the most horrible customer service in the world and I have spent the last 33 days traveling the world over 12+ hotels stayed at and this one was the absolutely the worse, I will never come back our recommend this hotel to anyone.",rudyv745,2017-07-03
"I am a local of the area and stayed here over night. The property itself is very old and has been here for many many years. The rooms were not as bad as I thought though as I entered mine. There were a few things in the room that needed fixing or attention, but other than that the room was fine. The front desk employee was very fast and had great customer service. This was the cheaper option out of all the hotels in the area that is why I chose to stay here. In conclusion, I recommend staying here for a short amount of time because of its location to the freeway and the room was clean enough to live with.",Solstice63,2017-06-06
"Clean room & bathroom. Ok pool area. Lots of parking. Noisy AC, loud sounds coming from the walls no idea what they were every time it was turned on. Good phone service. The hotel is being renovated but no inconveniences. Wifi works great. Decent size room. Weird cable channels, fuzzy did not come in clear. Very quiet stay. Good bedding. Complimentary breakfast is ok. Very helpful staff always a plus. ",marzj2017,2017-05-06
"We have stayed in many, MANY hotels and this has to come down as one of the worst.  From the management (Peggy) to housekeeping you feel like you are more in a sanitarium than a hotel.  The rooms are terrible and the breakfast is a 2 at the most. They were mostly proud of their pancake maker. Yes, pancake maker.  You poor in the syrup and it comes out as a pancake... sometimes.  They are great to play frisbee with!",tomcarterprod2016,2017-04-28
"I was OK with the missing toilet paper, lack of towels and even the top sheet for the bed. What did it for me was the stairwell that smelled so highly of urine that I I was about to throw up. I understand when u have to go but this was numerous occasions that it had been used as a toilet. Maybe a port o potty for the workers doing the renovation would help. Breakfast was good. Housekeeping was bothersome at 9am while myself and the boyfriend were getting busy. All in all-stay away from the stairwells.",873shawnad,2017-04-11
"This is a larger Quality Inn that works well when staying in the area.

The place is older and is getting some upgrades.  Overall, it's a fine place to stay when visiting the area.

The breakfast is good and includes eggs, pancakes, yogurt, breads, cereals, etc.  One day there were scrambled eggs and sausage and the other days there were fried eggs -- cooked 'till the yolks were hard -- and sausage.  The scrambled eggs were better.

The breakfast space is large, so there are enough tables for visitors -- something not all hotels have!

The place appears to have had a second building added, so there are ramps on each floor -- inside -- to connect them.

Finding stairs is tricky -- they aren't where you'd expect them, so look for the Exit signs.

The Olive Chinese Restaurant, inside the hotel, is a funny one for a hotel, but the food is good and the price is right!

Overall, a good choice for a place to stay in the area.",MikeVdP,2017-04-08
"Friendly staff and comfy beds. During my stay the hotel was going through some renovations. That didn't impact my stay though. My room was clean and roomy. The bed was very comfortable. I had a nice little balcony that caught the sun just right. There was a Continental breakfast included which had eggs, sausage, pancakes, toast, bagels, yogurt, juice, coffee, cereal, and oatmeal. Nearby there is a starbucks, Buffalo wild wings, McDonald's, and pizza studio and few more restaurant's within walking distance.",Y8345WMmarting,2017-03-16
"In 2016 we stayed at this hotel for one month. The friendly efficient service we received from Lynda is the reason for us returning for Jan, Feb and March 2017. Jim, at the front desk checked us in, when we first arrived, in a friendly and efficient manner and we have relied on him, at our request, to renew our booking each month. D, our breakfast waitress, is quick and always has a smile. Our room is pleasant and always kept very clean with a comfortable bed and a good sitting area. Any small maintenance problem is quickly taken care of. Location is good for shopping, entertainment and beach.",D3180OCroys,2017-03-14
"This is  a very nice Hotel located in great area on Hotel row. Very different from most Quality Inn. I stayed for several days, and since I had to modify my original reservation, they had to move me - and room downstairs was even better. Rooms are very very clean. Has Interior corridors. Just make sure you go have your breakfast by 9, since they immediately take everything out. I had issue, but it was resolved. There was Chinese restaurant I had dinner, and it was so so, and overpriced - wouldn't recommended.",OLSENN_13,2017-01-18
I came in late and left early so I didn't try the wireless. The front desk staff was helpful and efficient. My room was clean and exactly what I wanted in space. I didn't eat breakfast so I can't comment on it.,M4168WPkevinh,2016-12-15
"Professional Hospitality

What we look for in places we stay are professionals that know what hospitality is all about and this Quality Inn location does.

When it comes to hospitality and service this place gets a ""10"". The rooms are newly remodeled with new furniture, beds, paint and carpeting. My room was great!

I have been luck to have FADI as my host at check-in. His service is excellent and makes check-in a breeze!

This place is centrally located in Orange County with easy access to freeways. If you're in the area check them out...",TravelXer,2016-11-17
"The hotel is being renovated and I was told that I would be given a NEWLY renovated room.  The freezer section of the frig was frozen, the room smelled fresh, the linens were fresh but the sofa was recovered in a scary red shiney poka dot material.  Don't think I would sit on it.  I moved the sofa slightly away from the bed and the floor was dirty.....maybe in time things will very better. ",Nonna4308,2016-10-02
"The location was convenient and there were restaurants within walking distance...BUT the rooms were DATED. The wallpaper was peeling in the halls and paint was chipped. They had a sign saying ""renovating"" but we saw no one doing any such thing. Our balcony door didn't open, the bathroom sink didn't match up to the faucet and the water just went all over the counter, and there was a crowd of younger people staying across from us and seemed to be indulging in a hot box session of the green kind if you know what I mean. When I told the desk, he chuckled. Traveling with kids and having marijauna present did not sound remotely funny to me. We stayed for 2 nights for a sports tournament and the side entry/exit had a filthy busser's tray full of dirty dishes and trash next to it the entire time. No one moved it, no one cleaned it. I love to travel and most of the time am not looking for posh accommodations by any means, but this was subpar at very best and we will not be staying here again.",happyhumble5,2016-09-14
"Currently under renovation, Quality Inn & Suites still boasts a nice lobby, ample dining room space and also an on-site Chinese restaurant.

Sadly, our view was marred by a dumpster and construction detritus, but the customer service exhibited by Fadi & Jim was exemplary.

Thank you for a very enjoyable two-day stay.",Lobsterollsforever,2016-09-05
"We arrived early and went to see if we could check in early.   The manager on duty (Peggy) told us to sit down, she'd have an answer in 15 minutes.  After about 10 minutes we asked her again and she told us very rudely that nothing was available, and to come back later. I was not happy with her poor attitude.   When we did check in, hours later, a very nice gentleman checked us in. We told him of our previous experience with Peggy,  he told us that he knew but couldn't say anything. 
The room was very clean, the hotel is going through a remodel but we didn't notice any construction.  Breakfast offered free was decent but not fancy.  Overall hotel was ok but that manager need to learn what working in hospitality service means.",E5890GIlindas,2016-08-31
"My wife and I stayed one night in a room on the third floor.  Nearby are I-5 highway and Lake Forest blvd...which together creates road noise that is heard at night.  A/C is a separate unit that is wall mounted.  The air flow from it is noticeable when on the bed nearest it.  Beds were comfortable and bathroom is typical of a low/mid range hotel.  Compared to prices of nearby hotels it is quite reasonable.  Staff were nice.
There is a breakfast provided with room.  It has a large seating area and has usual items, but instead of a waffle maker it has a pancake making machine that is automatic. Press a button and the batter is poured and the pancake is cooked. The pancake is small and thin.  I tried one and found it bland and a little ""rubbery"".  The bacon is cooked and in a tray that had a lot of liquid fat at the bottom and when I picked up a bacon piece it dripped fat.  Not my type of bacon.
If I stayed again at the hotel it would only be because of the price.",travelnice,2016-08-30
"I had an enjoyable experience during my stay. The room was clean and comfortable, the general manager Penny answered all of my questions and provided excellent customer service, and the breakfast was great. The next time I plan on visiting I will definitely book my stay again with the Quality Inn.",152aishaw,2016-08-17
"I had written a review when the Quality Inn asked me how my stay was at the Quality Inn. I explained all of the issues I had in the review. Immediately the next day, the general manager Penny called me to discuss my experience and I told her the Interest was fast, the beds were out of this world but when I checked in the room I was assigned to the room had not been cleaned yet. And I was given the wrong room key type. Also, we had breakfast close to the end of the time it was open and the variety of food was less. Penny jumped into action, she explained they were booked up the night before and the cleaning staff work over time to get the rooms done and the key system was having a change over. The beauty of Penny is, she explained why the problems occurred and did not make excuses. The breakfast piece she would work with her staff on. Penny took care of the problem immediately making me a happy customer, and I would definitely return again. It was just the circumstances. Penny ""THANK YOU"" for having us as a guest and for taking care of the situation without argument!!",norifrasier,2016-08-13
"This hotel was very clean. The beds were comfortable which matters to my husband.
Inside hall to the rooms made us feel safe. The breakfast was nice but I missed the waffles. They had pancakes, eggs, bacon, and continental foods. The rooms were a nice side. The bathroom had been updated with granite countertop.",seenmanyplaces,2016-08-12
My wife and I stayed 2 nights and had a wonderful experience. The staff was very friendly and the manager Penny provided great customer service at the front desk. I would 100% recommend this hotel and whenever we are visiting family we will be staying here. Thank you Penny and the Quality Inn & Suites staff you were all amazing!!!,jakekosh26,2016-08-09
"My friend and I checked in with our two teenagers at 9 pm on a Saturday night in July. Fortunately, we had a reservation because the hotel was packed, but we had no problem finding convenient parking near the entrance.  When my friend went down to the lobby for more towels, the lobby desk clerk brought them up a few minutes later.  Our room was on the 3rd floor, on the side of the hotel facing the street, but surprisingly quiet.  The beds were comfortably firm with fluffy pillows and a cozy, lightweight comforter.
     I was impressed by the Olive Tree restaurant located inside the hotel.   Arriving at 9:10, after the official closing time, we were surprised to be welcomed in.  I was expecting a ""cookie cutter"" Chinese restaurant, but instead discovered a unique place run by a proud, skilled cook and his wife.  The pad Thai on the menu was authentic, and the orange chicken was declared by one of the picky eater teenagers to be ""the best I've ever had.""
      The next morning, having stayed at plenty of hotels with only a few tables in the breakfast area, I was happy to discover plenty of space to sit.  However, with the hotel completely full, it was impossible for the one man working the area to keep everything stocked.  The buffet officially closed at 9:30, and by 8:45, almost all of the fruit, and all the scrambled eggs and sausage were gone.  However, if you had time to wait a while and willingness to ask, the attendant would get you what you needed.  After 9:30, as he worked putting away breakfast supplies and cleaning tables, he was very friendly and helpful with some questions about things to do in the area.
     One last perk of this hotel was the small balcony off the room.  In Southern California, it's great to enjoy the night air on a balcony!
     P.S.  In the lobby, look up!  There's a cool chandelier.",teacherkaren2016,2016-07-27
"Stayed one night while attending a concert at Irvine Meadows. Two miles from venue, easy to Uber to and from. Honestly, I had read the bad reviews and took a chance. It maybe in the midst of renovation, but our room, above lobby, was quiet, very clean, and the air worked great as well as everything else in the room. The bed was one of the best mattresses I have slept on, even compared to some higher end hotels. Breakfast was your basic type, bujt hey, it is included. WiFi was actually suprisongly fast and I will go back there again. Look, for the price you pay for a room, it is better than most. It is a smiple yet functionable room, and even has a balcony. Conviently located, able to waalk to whatever you need.",ballerina501,2016-07-25
"I stayed at the Quality Inn and it is in need of an overhaul. I had a suite, which was large and quiet but the rooms are very rundown. My room had ants in the bathtub and sink. It had a dingy smell and was very old and outdated. There are a lot of families there and a Starbucks nearby. For business travelers it is not good.",938sarad,2016-07-21
"After finding out that I had made a reservation at the wrong location, and would be stuck with the charges, I appealed to the general manager, and am so relieved that she agreed to reimburse the charges, which she did not have to do. Thank you so much Penny! ",sunbeauty11,2016-07-20
"Very friendly service. The hotel is under major renovation and we where given a newer room. Reasonable price considering the location... 

I would stay again When I'm in the area.  This hotel is centrally located in Orange County and is about 15 minutes from the beach or Disneyland. It's easy to find just off of the 5 freeway. 

",TravelXer,2016-07-08
We really enjoyed our stay here. It has a beautiful lobby to begin with! Our room was nice and clean. We brought our little dog and they were very welcoming. We had a little trouble having to wait to check in because the computer system was down butt that was not their fault.  Nice hot water!  There were signs saying they were renovating but we never saw signs of it. Beautiful pool too!,brighteyesWisconsin,2016-07-02
"Upon arrival the general manager resolved a billing issue in my favor which I later realized was entirely my fault! Fadi at front desk was courteous, friendly and super helpful - professional. The room was clean. Bathroom spotless and updated. Nice decor. Bed was oh so comfortable. Free parking, wi-fi, breakfast (delicious). I will stay again.",maureend394,2016-05-07
Without going into allot of detail. Manager was courteous and diligent in addressing my concerns.  She accommodated me respectfully and assured my comfort.  Food is within walking distance the property has an Asian Restaurant located in the building that delivers at minimal cost.  This was very convenient.   I will definitely return for business or pleasure.,YCF5,2016-03-30
"Free parking, decent rates, with free breakfast and (super crappy) free Wi-Fi.

I had a three day stay. On day two, the workers replaced all the beds in the hotel with new ones, not mine of course, because I was already checked in. So, needless to say, so-so bed at best. The pillows are HORRIBLE! I woke every morning sore from the bunchy, well worn, and deflated pillows. 

As stated in previous reviews, no hot water (and once it does come in, it is DANGEROUSLY hot. Parents beware! My son was screaming and quite red, and he is no wimp.)

The room badly needed a face lift, as the 1985-esque wallpaper was peeling profusely. And the carpet had sticky un-identifiable substances in a few places.

Breakfast: Decent, no complaints 

Service: Wonderful, outside of the douchy morning guy with a contemptuous attitude and the fact that they ration your towels like you're in a nut house and plan to use them for escape. There was 5 of us in a 2 bed suite and we received 3 towels..ok, and receiving more took a minimum of an hour each time, 'cause yeah..that works with kids. ( We attempted to get in advance, and went directly to front desk, and both times towels were unavailable.)

Would only stay again if on a budget, traveling alone, in a jacuzzi suite. Best Western next door is in same price range so maybe I will give them a whirl. ..",cristinas554,2016-03-18
"Parking: Free lot with plenty of spaces.

Staff:  Very friendly and helpful.

Location:  Off the 5 freeway and easy to find.  Lots of things nearby, McDonald's is literally next door and so is a Shell gas station.  But plenty of other eateries and shopping nearby.

Hotel:  Beds are so so, rooms are adequate.  In terms of budget, this hotel fits your needs.  One comment about the TV, basic cable with no HBO or Showtime.  

Wifi:  Free but slow, I would have rather paid for WiFi.

Breakfast:  Not bad at all with pancakes, coffee, bagels, and yogurts.

Overall:  3/5 stars, average hotel that will fit your budget needs.",lionel86,2016-02-25
Was very close to the business I had to do while in town. The restaurant inside had some great food. Did not have any transportation so I can't tell what was nearby. Staff was very friendly and helpful to get me to where I needed to be when checking out.  Was pretty quiet slept OK ,46edwardj,2016-02-17
"We booked last minute needing somewhere for the night on a business trip. Good location right off the freeway. We arrived late and got right in. 

The room is okay. The bathroom had somewhat been renovated leaving old with new. I had left my purse on the dresser and in the morning picked it up and it was filled with bugs. Promptly threw it away. We will spend a few more dollars for the hotel next door.",Acefalo,2016-02-14
"Nice area, felt safe...would stay at this hotel again.  Central location for where we needed to be.   Breakfast was good and low cost on the rooms.  Didn't enjoy pool (little cold outside) or hot tub this trip..... but this hotel worked for us.",denisebG8266PU,2016-01-25
"Our stay at Quality Inn & Suites Irvine Spectrum in Lake Forest, California was a great memorable one. The rooms were clean, good and neat. The breakfast was delicious. The staff at the reception were so friendly.",prakashpathi,2015-12-31
"I needed a place for a quick in-out one night stay.  My class was nearby and started earlier than I could arrive by air, so the only choice was to fly down the night before.  I did a search on TripAdvisor for places nearby and the Quality Inn popped up.  I have stayed at Quality Inns before, and while not luxurious, the do have free wifi and free breakfast.  On occasion, I have run into hotels that don't start the breakfast until 7 or 7:30, later than I can deal with.  This hotel started at 6:30 so it worked well.  Food wasn't gourmet, but quite acceptable and it is nice that they have take-away cups for the coffee for the ride to the class.",Halems,2015-12-04
"Like my namesake, Jonathan H reviewed, this hotel is clean and cheap and sometimes that's all you need.  We just cleared out a house that we sold so we were tired, it was raining, and the Quality Inn was in front of us.  The rooms are large enough and definitely clean.   We originally were only going to stay for two days but ended up adding two more as the hotel was so convenient to the freeway and surrounding restaurants.  Olive Tree Chinese Kitchen inside the hotel is a diamond in the rough---fabulous food that is not salty or smothered in goopy sauces.  Dumplings rivaled China town.  Breakfast at the hotel was fine with full-sized yogurts, eggs, sausages, and good coffee.  Service is very good.",jsh35715,2015-11-07
"If you look up the definition of a 2-star hotel, you might find a picture of this Quality Inn in Irvine. It certainly meets all the criteria: It's outdated but serviceable, and you probably wouldn't want to stay more than one night.

Among the negatives: A sliding glass door to the balcony that wouldn't lock, awful WiFi speed, and zero hot water in the shower. The room is in desperate need of an upgrade, and the TV remote didn't work. But if your expectations are low before you arrive, it's fine. The front desk cashier was friendly and they had a decent free breakfast in the morning. The hotel is located next to a McDonalds, and there's a Starbucks/gas station just two minutes away. It's also close to the freeway. 

As long as you're not expecting anything more than 2 stars, this property will do. We were only there for a total of about 10 hours, and that was more than enough.",56waldorf,2015-10-25
The Quality Inn is a budget hotel for people looking for a cheap place to stay....the have free wifi and a free fill your tummy continental breakfast which is a better option than buy breakfast at McDonald's next door.  There's a pool and a cheap Chinese restaurant in the lobby.  Its actually a decent deal for what you pay,jonathanh385,2015-10-06
"If you are on a budget it will be okay but I wouldn't stay too long. Here are some of the issues that may be a concern to you. First the lobby and hall ways are not air conditioned making hot days in these areas unbearable. This might make the staff cranky as well... 

Second the keys to the room did not function well requiring several trips to the front desk a hassle. While making several trips you'll notice the elevators are extremely slow and blazing hot when you are in them.... 

Free breakfast was not as good as other hotels as well. My recommendation if not a a strict budget try some place else in the area....",286RickM,2015-09-10
"This hotel was ok for our purposes. it was a place to shower and sleep. We did not intend to make it a resort stay.  It was really convenient to the freeway, shopping, and the place we were going each day. The hotel needs refurbishing. Everything was worn, but clean, except for the long black hairs on the bathroom floor after the maid had been there each day. It wasn't that the staff was unfriendly, they were just indifferent. Breakfast was mediocre at best. With all the hotels in the area, we probably wouldn't stay here again.",moses72548,2015-09-01
"I was traveling with a very budget conscious group for a conference in the area.  The hotel was fine, but worn. It definitely needs a cosmetic updates.  Some of the King bed rooms on the interior hall of the 3rd floor of the front building have cool vaulted ceilings so they seemed more spacious.  The outer rooms are just plain and small.  The beds/bath were clean, but there were some cigarette burns on the comforters and weird stains on the wall.  The area looks a little dodgy, but is near some decent neighborhoods.  We also think that the gas from our van may have been siphoned/stolen one night. It is hard to find good deals in Southern California so this place works if your money is tight.",SuzB0203,2015-08-28
"Staff not very friendly, Room was too hot when I arrived, by the time it cooled down enough to sleep it was 3:30 am and I had to get up at 5:30 am, the web site they said they offer a free shuttle within a 5 mile radius and when I asked they said we don't do that.Had I known this I would not have booked here. I don't think I would booking here again when I come to Cali again.",700robinm,2015-08-26
"This is a decent hotel, right off the freeway, so it's easy to find. Traffic is horrendous, but depending on time of day, it's a pretty short drive to Laguna Beach and some shopping centers. There is not much in the neighborhood of the hotel. Nothing in walking distance, except a Mcdonalds next door. The hotel is clean, and the rooms were nice and pretty quiet. They have complimentary breakfast, with hot foods and cold. ",Lotitravel,2015-08-02
Near freeway and not too far from Irvine.  Rooms are dated and front desk staff was generally polite but not great.  The breakfast was adequate and the lobby was relatively clean though not used to seeing so much fake greenery and flowers everywhere.  We did not use the pool and I hardly saw the restaurant open though we were gone most of the time.  Lots of families and a good value for the area.,NomadicSandra,2015-07-26
"Right off the freeway, easy to find.
Hotel needs a remodel. Rooms are dated but functional. Beds are ok. Shower is good. Pool is nice, outdoor.
Staff need a training in customer service. Looks and acts like they don't want to be there. Not very focused on customer service.
Free computer and printer access.
Parking is free.
Chinese restaurant at hotel, nice staff and food is fair.
AC unit is loud in the rooms.
Breakfast is basic, fruit, bagels, waffles eggs...
Would look at other options for next trip.",MAUREENH47,2015-07-16
"I really like this place when I need to visit my Kids. It is a very nice location

"As a Travel Agent/Owner of CruiseOne - Erik Fischer & Associates I would have to say this is on my top 5 of worst properties I have ever stayed at. Upon arrival in the early afternoon the employee (unknown when we drove up) was smoking and looked agitated when he put it out and walked inside behind the desk. They gave me a smaller room than requested. When I questioned him about this he was fairly argumentative and said I booked it online. I advised I called because they had the same picture for all the suites and I particularly wanted a 1 bedroom. Instead he put us in a junior suite and stated thats all they had. He then went on to tell me I was lucky he was checking me in before 3:00 pm as that is when check in time is. I told him I gave never had an issue with checking in early at other hotels and he argued with me no other hotel does it either. I asked if he wanted me to name who does and he said yes. It was like he was calling me a liar. Turns out he was the General Manager of this property and his name was Darren Yang. 

Room as as far back as you could get on the property. Upon entering I got hit with a extremely strong oder of mildew/mold. It was strong everywhere. The comforter really smelled of mildew. My nose instantly clogged up. When I went to call the phone did not work. I then found ants all over the bath tub. They were coming and going from the water valve and the overflow drain and I was on the third floor. 

I chose not to eat there as this hotel was a train wreck. Management was so very unprofessional and room was horrible. I told him what I did professionally and I would be reviewing his property but he did not care.

Bottom line.... stay clear of this property unless you don't care about the things I mentioned. I have stayed at all types of properties for my job from 5 star resorts to 1 star small family run properties and this is most definitely on my top 5 of worst which is disappointing as it is in a great location. It just needs new management and to be shut down for a renovation and fumigation.

Again, I will never return and I recommend the same to you.",CAP679915,2015-07-05
"In short, the best value I've found when work takes me to Orange County. 
This hotel is a border-line 2.5 star/3 star. It does have a restaurant (banker hours though so I've never been), but it does offer a free HOT breakfast that I've always enjoyed (especially their eggs and sausage).
There rates have been the best I can find for a 2.5 or 3 star hotel, and the 24-hour front desk has proven to be helpful more than just once.
I also really appreciate that most rooms at this hotel are not only spacious and equipped with microwaves, mini fridges, and flat screen TV's, but also come with private balconies.

"I booked 6 rooms for my soccer team and their families because we were participating in a tournament in Mission Viejo. The location was excellent due to it being a short drive to Oso Complex. Each party had a minimum of 2 parents plus 1 teenager and we checked in Saturday evening around 5pm. Check in was great and no one had any issues. We also had one party that checked in at midnight with no issues to report. First, yes this is an older hotel but honestly if you want a ""new"" hotel you have to pay the price for that quality. We wanted convenience and  financially friendly. The rooms were fine and ALL parties said they were very pleased with their rooms. One negative, the AC was not kicking our freezing cold air even when the temp was adjusted to 60 degrees, but it was cold. Rooms were clean, showers worked fine, and the beds were comfortable. Positive, if you have kids the rooms have two Queen beds, not doubles, which was awesome for my two kids to sleep on. Pool area and spa was great. We used the washer/dryer to clean uniforms and detergent/coins could be purchased at front desk. Detergent was $2, wash cost $2, dry cost $2. All families took advantage of the free breakfast which was great. Everyone was pleased with the food. If your not a fan of the food their is a McDonalds in the parking lot. I liked the free breakfast! There is a chinese restaurant inside the hotel but we did not eat there. 
Only negative, not the hotel, is that people who stay can smoke. I don't smoke cigarettes and those who do usually have the smoke stay on their clothes and on any material they come in contact with. A guest was smoking on the balcony and I am sure the room will smell like smoke. Other than that everything was great and i would stay here again with my family for a short 1-2 stay. If looking for romantic getaway, this is not your spot. I recommend for short stay with kids/teens.",F9684ELpaulm,2015-06-08
"This is an old building that has been reasonably maintained, but shows it's age in some common areas like the garage, stairwells and pool area. I would have given this just an ""okay"" review, but for the 4 days I stayed there was always a problem with the hot water in my third floor room.  On two mornings there was none at all until I complained at the front desk and they said they had just ""reset"" the boiler. I had to wait a half hour an then the water was only tepid and barely warm enough to take a shower. On the third day the said the boiler had been ""fixed"" but in the next morning it was back to ""barely warm enough"" water.  In the afternoon and evening the water was properly hot so I decided to bathe before bed to ensure I had some. The room I had overlooked the pool located in the central courtyard, and it can be quite noisy with a group of people there.  On one night a large noisy group of teens decided to have a pool party until closing time, and I couldn't get to sleep for the noise even with the window closed.",585matthewh,2015-06-03
"My wife and I stayed at this hotel recently when attending a concert at the Verizon Ampitheater (now Irvine Meadows).  The first impression is that this is a very nice place as the lobby area is beautiful.  However, once we got into our room it was apparent that this is an older hotel that has had some cosmetic improvements but is still in need of a major overhaul and maintenance.  The drain stoppers in both the bathroom sink and tub were broken.  We also found a dirty t-shirt left on the floor from a previous occupant so the cleaning staff is questionable as far as their attention to duty.  They have a restaurant at this hotel which was ok.  (Chinese food)  The desk staff was also very slow and they didn't seem to know what they were doing.  I can't recommend this hotel as I am sure there are better places to stay in the area.",stevencH4861VJ,2015-05-27
"I picked this hotel because of its close proximity to the Irvine Amphitheater and the fact that they had shuttle service.  I booked ahead as the weekend was a surprise birthday present for my wife.  I called two days before to confirm everything and was informed they no longer did any shuttle service.  Alright, we'll work around the inconvenience.  Upon arrival, I was greeted with a big smile by Maj.  This, of course, was after she finished her texting.  Later I visited the front desk with a question, and again waited while the texting continued.  The next day at checkout, I was surprised to see Maj again with front-desk duty, with the obligatory wait while texts are completed.  Other than that, our visit was pleasant but too brief.  The room was clean and comfortable.  The TV was large but with only local and standard channels.  I would consider staying here again.  I would have given four stars, but having my own business, it was irritating to see someone who was hired to do a job playing on her phone.",travelforfunnstuff,2015-05-24
"For the price paid (~$100) and compared to other similarly priced hotels in the area, this hotel was bad. Its a slight step up from Motel 6, but below comparable budget chain hotels. 

First of all, the hotel is named  ""Quality Inn & Suites Irvine Spectrum"". This hotel is 3 miles from the Irvine Spectrum and the neighborhood is a big drop down from Irvine. 

Second, the rooms were really old. The room smells like cigarettes (even though the rooms were non smoking) and was really dark and poorly lit. The furniture was old, the carpet stained and had holes, and the curtains didn't work well so it was hard to get light in. Plus, it was really noisy from the freeway (even though I didn't face the freeway (Room 303) even with the sliding door closed.

Third, the free breakfast was not good. Juice was water like, eggs tasted like it was powdered, and rolls from $1 stores. Granted it was Free, but for a couple of bucks the McDonalds next door breakfast is a lot better. 

Fourth, I had a dispute with the front desk and corporate office regarding their Choice Privileges Hotel Reward Program. Rather than being a little accommodating and understanding, they were incompletely inflexible.

Overall, I will never stay here (or likely another Choice property (due to the dispute)) again as I believe there are better options for similar value elsewhere where my business is appreciated.",ewoo72,2015-03-27
"The area the hotel is located in is not great. Check in was fairly quick and i took the old elevator to the second floor.
Upon entering my room I got a smell of Damp and the room was dark and poorly lit. The room was very dated , but it was pretty much what i expected for the price, one of the cheapest hotels in the area.",497jaydal,2015-03-17
I have to admit it... I am a high maintenance Hotel customer. I like to stay at nicer places because they make me feel like I'm somebody important.

These are great employees and are excellent at customer service.,damonb533,2015-03-05
"When I arrived I was greeted by a sign in the counter saying someone will be back in five minutes, should have said ten.  My credit card imprint for incidentals was taken on an old imprinter on a piece of paper which now sits who knows where?  I had to walk through a wall of water pouring through the ceiling on the second floor walkway.  Literally a wall of water.  As I walked into the room there was a musty smell and many cosmetic flaws (wallpaper peeling) and possible water damage that was poorly repaired. Soffit above sink was only about 6 feet tall causing many head bumps. Bathroom was poorly lit and there was some mold on the ceiling in the shower.  There was no attention to detail anywhere.  All spaces were dated and needed updating.  Stairways weren't marked well I had to look at map in room to find their locations.  When i did use them they were dirty and were clumsily repaired including screws used to Hold down the plastic traction coverings.  Tripping hazard?  I booked this online.  Maybe they give the online bookings unremodeled rooms?  Pool had debris on the bottom. I won't ever stay here again.  Staff could use hospitality training also. Not friendly not hostile either just didn't seem professional or outgoing. Fridge and micro were stacked several feet from desk and looked out of place. Two lights weren't plugged in and the clock was not set even close to the correct time.  No attention to details.

"Was retreiving my Ford, at a nearby dealership. And took the train from the IE,. the afternoon before. I Thought:' ""how conveinient and well planned"",. It Was. I chose a room on the 3rd floor, which offered a Huge-pitched ceiling. I requested a nice view. I got: a view of an empty parking lot, and bustling commerce on the adjacent I-5 freeway. There was a balcony as well. Couch. Work Area. Good A/C. Big acceptable bed. In Room Coffee. But Nasty' Included' morning breakfast. Those Eggs? Oily? with crusty stuff around the edge. Not tantalizing. ust standard oily bacon. The Attitude and display of this AM breakfast, felt more like an Instutution. and Something from eastern europe?

"My family and I were attending an event about 10 minutes away and this was the cheapest hotel in the area. It is right off the freeway which made it easy. Even though there is a parking garage, the lot fills up at night. Check in was easy enough. The breakfast was good, waffles, bagels, pastries, oatmeal, fruit. Make sure you get there early because it was busy and had to wait about 10 minutes to get a waffle. The room itself was clean, the bed was comfortable, but the carpet needs to be replaced. The bathroom needs an upgrade. There were broken tiles, faucet was falling apart, and the hairdryer made weird noises and didn't dry that well.  The staff was friendly. If you need to crash in the area, why not?",MrsBrandt,2014-09-05
Me and my boyfriend only stayed for one night while we were visiting Laguna Beach for a small budgeted getaway. However we had a very nice stay for a decent price. We checked in late at night and the front desk was exceptional. This hotel was clean and I would stay again.,GraceIshak,2014-08-11
"This motel is average at best. It's off of the 5 Freeway on Rockfield in a business park next to a McDonald's. If you see the McDonald's turn there! Otherwise you might bypass the motel. There are other ways of accessing this place, but this is the easiest. The neighborhood houses mid-scale types of restaurants and shops. Nothing fancy. Nothing real good. The mall down the road has seen better days. My room overlooked the pool. On stuffy days (which I had while I was there) the chlorine suspended in the air. So I closed the balcony door and turned on the air conditioner. The pool, though, is actually useful and there is a small exercise area. When I was there youth baseball players were using the facilities. The lobby is large, there's a guest computer useful for replacing the ""iffy"" Wi-Fi, and there's also an on-site Chinese restaurant. The continental breakfast is free but, if there is a large group staying there, try to eat early so you still have some good food choices left. My room had a fridge and microwave. Good for storing some drinks, groceries, and cookies. But I didn't like the bed pillows. They were shaped like rectangles and too firm. The motel is an easy drive down to the beachfront at Laguna. But you'll need to get an early start for free parking. Otherwise, you can feed the meters or park in the pay lots. Laguna does provide shuttle service. Free in the summer, a small fee other times. But I parked at the Laguna Hills Mall, hailed the 89 bus, paid a small fare and, 25 minutes later, was dropped 4 blocks from the sand. If you do this, check the schedule for the return because the evening buses run but once an hour.",Zoom_Gotti,2014-08-01
"This was the worst hotel experience for our money we have ever had. We paid $159/night and this hotel is more in value compared to a Motel 6, pretending to be something better. We reserved a non-smoking room, which wreaked of smoke. A dirty towel was left on the floor. A bed skirt was splattered with who knows what. The decor and decorations are cheap and thrown together. No coffee packets were provided in the room. When we did get them, we found out the coffee maker did not work properly, had coffee all over the place. The sliding door lock was broken, only the bar to keep it secure. Pool edge was about 5 feet from our room, extremely noisy, room 142. TV was not plugged in, but figured that out eventually. Someone elses hairs were in the sink upon arrival. Witnessed a server snap at a guest at breakfast, for no apparent reason, other than she was overworked and frustrated. Only one server was not enough for the amount of people trying to get breakfast. Coffee out, pastries out, forks gone, regular waffle mix out. Sand or some odd substance inside the entry to the outside. Halls/stairwells to outside were filthy. Carpets in the room made you feel dirty. Room door would not close unless you pulled it closed. This hotel is outdated and in need of major upgrades and deep down cleaning, as well as better management of housekeeping and maintenance.
It was a place to sleep, nothing more, and we won't be back.",Angie423,2014-07-29

"I booked a five night stay. When I returned to the room it was cleaned but all the blankets were thrown on the sofa. I tried to call but the phone didn’t work. I called the hotel from my Cell and spoke to Jim. I told him that I was in room 231 and the phone didn’t work. He responded with a smart answer that I needed to push a button to get a dial tone, which I tried and pushed line one and line two. Then I explained my issue with the blankets. Again a smart answer - that means they should be back in maybe 10 minutes to make the bed. Twenty minutes later I called the toll free number but was told I couldn’t file a complaint until I checked out. So I  checked out early and booked with Best Western located behind thier location. Basically this location didn’t have enough sheets for the rooms occupied. I been a customer for a while but this is the last time I will stay at a Choice Hotel. By the Wat Best Wester Spectrum is Awesome !!!",NicoVas1,2014-06-17
"I went to Orange County for a sporting event from 6/5 to 6/9/2014 and got a great deal on this Hotel through priceline. My expectations were not too high considering the relatively low star rating and some critical reviews. I have to say that the Hotel exceeded all my expectations in any way.. I got there at 2:30, 30 minutes prior to their 3 PM check in time and the friendly young lady at the front desk were able to get me into a room after checking with the cleaning staff. The lobby looked very clean.. The front doors looked a little dated and could use a fresh coat of paint and the AC vents in the lobby showed a little bit of age, but other than that, the impression was flawless.. When I got to the room, I was pleasantly surprised.. The room was good size with a small balcony. The room appeared remodeled with upgraded bathroom and newer looking furniture. Bed was comfortable for me as I do like firmer beds like the one they had. Pillows are kinda small but as there were 4 of them on the king size bed, that wasn't a problem.  There was no noise etc. at any time that I spent in my room.. Just quiet and relaxing. Everything in the room was working and I took advantage of the little fridge to keep my sports drinks cool. 
The breakfast was a typical Hotel breakfast. The sausage was actually pretty good! The location is very good and lots of places in walking distance including the #1 rated Restaurant in the area, Peppino's.. There is also a Panera right in front of Peppino's. For those who prefer McDonalds, there is one right across from the Hotel. I did not use the pool but it appeared clean and inviting.
I think that with a little bit of minor maintenance (like painting the exterior right where the main entrance is), painting or replacing the front doors and replacing some of the ac vents that show some age, this should be at least one star higher rated.. I've been to 3.5 star Hotels that weren't any nicer than this one. I will likely be back at the Quality in in Lake Forest next year when I'm in the area again!",OlivierM698,2014-06-11

"I was attending a wedding reception close by this hotel.  We decided it would be a good place to stay the night rather than drive back to San Diego late at night.  It took sometime to check in because the manager was behind the desk and there appeared to be no help.  I was not expecting luxury first class service so I was ok with waiting a bit.  However I did not bargain for bed bugs.  We stayed the night, checking out on Sunday morning. Driving home I started itching. I looked at my arms and had numerous bits.  I checked the symptoms on line and it proved to be bed bug bits.  It is one of the most miserable itchy, ugly, things I'm living through... 2 days later I still have welts.  I'm taking a medication and using copious quantities of anti itch lotion.  BTW: we also noticed that the hot tub was filthy and opted not to use it...maybe this was my clue of what was to come.  No quality here, just bed bugs!",carlyny2014,2014-05-20

"We were in Lake Forest for a family reunion.  We arrived a few days ahead of others in our group.  The hotel was once nice but badly in need of updating. Soiled paint and peeling wall paper.  The hotel is clean enough but gives an overall shabby appearance due to paint and wall paper issues.  There was also a very large, beautiful chandelier in the lobby.  The chandelier had not been cleaned in a very long time and looked dull and dirty.
The hotel was understaffed and I had to go to desk to get items needed for the room.
The day the rest of our party arrived there was a small letter sized sign at the desk advising that the electricity would be off from 10 pm until 6 am.  Several in our group had small children and would need to be up changing diapers and feeding.  No electricity was NOT an option.  When the desk personnel was told they did not desire to stay under these circumstances, the hotel told them they would NOT refund their deposit.   
We would not have even known there would be no electrify if our group had not been checking in and seen the small sign.",perrjojo,2014-04-04

"When we (3 rooms booked) it was before 3 -2:15p.m. The two men in our party, my husband and another man were allowed to check in BUT the one woman in group was told she and her sister had to wait until 3. Why? So we all waited for her to check in. By the by hotel was not busy. Rooms were clean enough although our bathtub would not turn off all the way-so quite a waste of water. Hot breakfast? A joke. WE waited 20 minutes for scrambled eggs-they didn't materialize so I went to front desk-same guy as day before still didn't care and neither did the young woman preparing food. Remember the commercial ""1 potato, 2 potato...?"" No milk for cereal, no coffee (reg or decaf), no fruit just some remnants of what might have been an hour earlier AND ""breakfast"" still had 40 minutes to go. reiterating, hotel not busy.

"You get what you pay for.

Pros: cheap, especially if you get an Express Deal through Priceline. Spacious king bed rooms, adequate bathrooms and breakfast. Central location.

Cons:
1. First room had strong urine smell coming from bath tub. They switched me to a cleaner room that smelled better.
2. Internet speeds, especially at night for some reason, are slowest I have experienced in any hotel. Sometimes, I got dropped and could not reconnect without explanation. Front desk couldn't help obviously.
3. Could be cleaner.
4. Would you believe my room phone was dead? Front desk didn't believe me, told me I shouldn't expect a dial tone. Then we tested it and they believed. Nothing done to remedy that.
5. Except for the bathroom outlet and the one attached to the desk lamp, none of the other outlets would hold the plugs. They would fall out immediately unless you taped them to the outlet. I carry multiple chargers/ power adaptors and don't like leaving them in the bathroom. This is 2013.
6. Tiny, uncomfortable pillows.",CaliforniaRamblin,2013-09-16
"This hotel looks and feels old and outdated. We ended up here because someone booked it for us on a team trip. The location right off the freeway is convenient and its close to plenty of restaurants and other shopping and locations. Walking in the lobby is full of silk plants and the reservation desk has a ceiling overhang I could reach up and touch. As soon as I saw that one of letters of the hotel name had fallen off and was stuck to the wall away for its a original spot I took it as a red flag. The poor guy checking us in had some kind of issue and even though there was a list and room key envelopes laid out knowing they were expecting guests the check in process was long and painful even though we had a reservation. 

We stayed on the 3rd floor and I would highly recommend staying on this floor. We had a balcony you could actually go out on and a super high vaulted ceiling that made the room feel spacious. We had a 1980's wood paneled mini fridge, that worked. There was a large flat screen tv. But the bathroom was half updated making it feel a little awkward. The beds were comfortable but small we didn't hear cR noise from the Mcdonalds next door or parking lot below. Luckily we weren't spending much time there.",skittlebean,2013-09-07
"Someone tried to come into our room at 3am.  I was woken up by a loud bang, and thought I saw light by the door.  I just figured my daughter was in the bathroom.  Turns out she wasn't. I noticed the security bar was pushed against the wall the next morning, and realized someone did try to come in. 
I told the manager at the desk the next morning, he was rude, snotty, and asked why I didn't ""call him when it happened since he was there all night, there was nothing he could do about it now"". I'd already explained I didn't realize what had happened until I got up later.
Besides the fact that unless a person has the card keyed for the room, no one should have been trying to get in at 3am.
The breakfast was terrible, and overall the staff we encountered were very unfriendly.

The room felt a little dirty but wasn't worth complaining about, though it did smell like someone had been smoking in it and was evident by the burn on the bed sheets.
The positive thing was that after 10:00pm there was a lot of noise coming from the pool, we called the front desk and the clerk was apologetic for not having been aware but within 5 minutes of being told the noise stopped. ",tdem523,2013-08-15
"First the good: Centrally located -- close to highways, shopping, and restaurants. Housekeeping kept the rooms stocked and cleaned up. Wi-fi was slow, but free. 

Everything else was mediocre to heinous. The full breakfast wasn't very appetizing -- mostly pre-made stuff except for the waffles which you could make yourself. This ""non-smoking"" hotel was anything but. Smoke smell was everywhere. And we're not just talking cigarettes -- people were visibly lighting up pot on the balcony of their room. Worst of all -- the front desk staff, Jim especially, was exceptionally rude and did not exhibit the slightest bit of good customer service.If that weren't bad enough, a photocopy of my credit card (as well as others who checked in) was made at check-in -- even though it had already been run through the charge machine -- and when I found this out, he outright refused to give it back and said that he would have to check me out if he gave it back. When I did check out, he still refused to give it back citing that every hotel in the country does it. I reported it to my credit card company and they were appalled (they luckily reported it to their fraud division and sent me a new card).

Long story short, it was better than nothing -- but next time I'll pay the extra bucks and go to a hotel where they know the meaning of hospitality instead of trying to make you feel like they're doing you a favor.",macdeux,2013-08-10
"Checked in at 7:00 p.m. and my room wasn't ready.  Next day, came back to my room at 4:00 p.m. and it hadn't been cleaned yet.  Third day, the room was cleaned early but housekeeping didn't leave me any towels or pillow cases.

Staff is clueless and rude.  Hotel is old, dingy and smells.

Also, when I read ""Quality Inn and Suites Irvine Spectrum, I assumed it was next to the Spectrum.  Nope, its not.  5 minutes up the highway by car, 25 minute walk.  If you can't walk to a place in 5-10 minutes, you shouldn't advertise the location in the name of your hotel.",933ks,2013-07-31
"Check in time is 3 p.m.... or later. When we arrived at 2 and after we waiting in line for 5 minutes, we were told they were short-staffed and we would have to come back and check in after 3:30. Our choice was to leave or sit in their very dingy lobby. We left. When we finally got into our room at 3:45 it was less than inviting. Immediately stripped off the ugly, dingy, probably dirty bedspread and put on slippers so I wouldn't have to walk barefoot on the carpet. Cranked the air conditioner down to the lowest possible temperature because the room was stifling hot.

After a late-evening event we were forced to park in a poorly-lit parking garage and return to our room, past the out-of-order elevator, past the rooms where they store ""stuff"" with steel security doors with no doorknobs, through the filthy service corridor/walkway to the pool, to the only working elevator at the front of the hotel. Oops. Forgot something in the car. Didn't feel at all safe walking back to the car alone at 11 p.m.

Breakfast -- served only until 9:30 the next morning -- was mediocre at best. Flavorless. Minimal. NASTY coffee. Brown fluffy bread (you know what brand I mean) billed as ""wheat"" bread.

I suppose that the value was good, but I know there are other hotels nearby that offer rates just as good, with much better amenities. I've stayed there. Took a chance on this one.

This hotel may have Quality in its name, but zero in its accommodations. Won't stay there again.",Kerikns,2013-07-25
"I spent nearly a week at this hotel.  As a business traveler, my needs are simple: peace and quiet, hot shower, temperature control, wake-up call.  I was offered a choice of several hotels in the area by my client, and chose this Quality Inn because of the perks: free hot breakfast, parking, wifi, fridge and microwave.

Things started going south upon check-in, when the desk clerk put me in a room that didn't remotely resemble the one that had been booked for me: a king bed suite with a pull-out sofa and balcony.  Instead, I was given a regular room with 2 queen beds and no balcony or sofa bed.  The clerk said she'd move me to another room the following day, but although I saw her at the front desk literally every day that week, she never followed through.

I soon discovered the refrigerator in my room didn't close properly, and thus spoiled $15 worth of leftovers.  A male desk clerk replaced the fridge for me the following day--good.  However, that night the same female desk clerk failed to plug in my wakeup call for the following morning--bad.  Luckily I had my iPhone alarm as a backup.

On the second night of my stay, I was extremely tired, and at 8:30PM ready for bed.  I had no sooner doused the lights when a ruckus in the parking lot outside my window woke me up; it was a screeching chorus of hundreds of pre-teen children's voices, in a Chinese dialect.  At first I thought, ""Oh, surely they're just making a pit stop at the McDonald's next door,"" never dreaming the screeching throng would be checking into the hotel.  But they did, by the busload.

Yes, this rowdy group of at least 100 noisy children swarmed into the hotel lobby, which was just below my room.  In her infinite wisdom, the female desk clerk managed to book two groups of pre-pubescent boys--4 to the room--in the room adjacent to mine, and the one directly above me.  My room had a shared door with the room next door, and the kids continuously tried to enter my room, pounding and shaking the door as they hollered at one another.  The kids above me must moonlight as gymnasts, because they were constantly stomping and pounding on the floor, to the point that the ceiling and walls in my room actually shook.

After half an hour of chaos, I went down to complain to the front desk clerk.  She said ""we're getting a lot of complaints,"" as if our conversation should somehow end there.  Luckily, the hotel's manager, who is of Chinese ancestry and spoke the same dialect as the youngsters, appeared, and said he personally would speak with the children in the room next to mine.  True to his word, he admonished the kids to keep quiet, as did the 3(!) adults traveling with the 100+(!) children.  The kids did settle down; but the little gymnasts upstairs tumbled for another hour.

After another complaint to the front desk clerk yielded zero results, I finally went upstairs myself.  A young kid who couldn't have been older than 8 opened the door; he spoke enough English to understand what I was saying, and apologized for the stomping/jumping.  I asked him if there was an adult in the room, but there wasn't, only 3 other boys, none of whom appeared to be older than age 10.  All was well for about 20 minutes; then the stomping resumed.  Again I had to contact the front desk, and after about 30 more minutes, things were finally quiet.  By that point I had lost 2 hours of sleep.

The next morning I woke at about 7:30 and went down to the breakfast bar; to my dismay, the horde of children had descended upon it en masse, and 6 deep.  A tiny opening appeared in front of the coffee machine; I had no sooner edged toward it than 5 kids ran right in front of me, cutting off access.  Even more maddeningly, they just stood there, obviously not interested in coffee, merely wanting to cut in line just in case there was something they did want.  The poor woman who serviced the breakfast bar tried to wade through the kiddie swarm, holding hot dishes aloft and hollering ""excuse me, excuse me!"" to no avail, as the kids wouldn't even let her through to service the bar.  Finally, an adult connected to the group appeared, lectured the children loudly, and managed to get them to form a queue--which lasted for about 15 minutes.  I grabbed what sustenance I could and escaped to my room.

Shortly before I left that morning, I saw the children's bus outside my window; the kids were boarding, suitcases in tow.  ""Good!"" I thought, optimistic this episode was a fluke, that the rest of the week would be quiet, and the hotel would in fact revert from a playground to a hotel.

Alas, the following evening--and EVERY evening thereafter--a similar group of children appeared like clockwork at 8:30PM, swarmed the lobby, and treated the hotel like it was their personal, noisy playspace.  Same complaints to the front desk, every night.  Same problems with the breakfast bar ... every morning.

It's unfortunate, because this hotel had such promise in the beginning.  Yes, they're doing some things right--free perks, even underground parking--but there's no substitute for peace and quiet and a good night's sleep.  Business travelers, caveat emptor.",McWidget,2013-07-22
"We came to this hotel after leaving another nightmare place in the middle of the night. This was so much better! We travel with little ones, so our expectation's are not exceptionally high, being that we have to stay within a tight budget, but this hotel exceeded our expectations. Location was great, right off the freeway and in a good part of town. The breakfast was fine, better that most with the sausage and eggs. Orange juice was a little strong though. The room was a decent size and clean, beds were comfy. Nice bathroom. My husband used the fitness center and said that was a joke. Every machine was not only broken, but destroyed. Looked like there had not been a staff member in there to clean things up for fix the place in years. He said he also wouldn't touch the hot tub with a 10 foot pole. Didn't use the pool, but it looked decent. Lots of restaurants within walking distance and the staff was nice.",kandiw479,2013-07-07
Was really surprised at how nice this hotel turned out to be. The hotel lobby was very nice and the rooms were better than I thought. The staff was very nice and friendly. The location is also very nice being close to Irvine Spectrum. Would definitely stay here again,AnnetteM992,2013-07-07
"Nothing to write home about, but a decent place to lay your head at night. It's located right next to a McDonald's (for better or worse), but easy to get to from the highway. Hotel seems to be fairly old but they've tried to keep it up to par. Rooms are nothing fancy but simple and neat. I was on the 3rd floor and imagine these are better because I had a cool high slanted ceiling. Also mini-fridge and microwave were very nice to have in the room. Overall, not bad but nothing fancy.",Meliggy,2013-06-21
"I have stayed here many times over the past few years but I think I'll try something different in the future. The owner/manager is skimping on the small stuff to increase profits. Example, the ice machine on the 3rd level was broken so they removed it entirely and have no plans to replace it. (According to the desk clerk). You only get 2 bath towels, 1 regular and 1 decaf coffee. The sinks don't drain properly in more that one room I've stayed in and what rubs me the most is that you can book a room a month in advance requesting a certain floor and location I.E. facing away from Lake Forest Drive and when I checked in last time I was told that the rooms on the other side of the hall were already booked so I get the noisy room. Problem I had with this is the parking spaces were only half or so full. Who gets these rooms? Friends? Family member? So this has become a ho hum place to stay in my book. The breakfast is always good, the room is clean but they should wash the glass patio doors occasionally.",RoyR937,2013-05-28
"We have stayed at this hotel about four times in the last three years. Every stay it gets worse and worse. First they had a nice restaurant and bar that they closed down for no good reason. 
The meeting room had leaks in the ceiling which made the room smell like mold. They fixed the leak the next time we were there, but that smell might never go away. The hotel is clean most of the time, but at all hours of the night there is always some sort of party going on.
 
At the end of our relationship with this hotel, the manager was so sour and bitter, she slammed doors around and pouted.

If you want to stay at an average hotel, stay here. The front desk and other staff is friendly, but thats about it!",453ValerieB453,2013-05-22
We had a party there and the hotel and staff where great. The place is clean and well laid out. They did everything possible to make our stay a joyous one. A special thank you to Linda for keeping up on all the little details so the party would run smoothly. And thank you to the cleaning staff for afterwards. And the price was great for the nice rooms we had and the fun spa.,Micr0N,2013-01-03
"First impression was not great...our clerk was a bit odd and was not helpful at all, when we asked where the best place to park to be closest to our room he said ""anywhere on the property"" which was not the case... our room he said was ""just down the hall"" which was not the case.  He did allow us to check in a hour before 'check in time' which was nice.  The rooms were average..a couple of things that stood out to me were the bed spreads seemed very worn, you could not have the refrigerator and the microwave plugged in at the same time (but hey not all rooms come with such amenities.)   The heater worked great but it sounded like a freight train wreck each and every time it kicked on all through the night.  The hot tub was not working until the morning we left. One more added note:  The breakfast area offered a great hot waffle breakfast with eggs and bacon but is not in any way handicap accessible it is down four steps with no other entry, I watched an elderly lady trying to manage her wheeled walker down and the attendant was ""not allowed to help her down the stairs."" I would probably not stay here again I would try the Comfort Inn and Suites located just around the corner.",Cherith7,2012-12-26
"Stayed here for just one night.  It is in a very convenient location.  Rooms were clean and beds were comfortable.  Big flat screen TV was a surprise.  Breakfast was good - no complaints there.  Nothing special but a nice, inexpensive place to stay close to the I5 in Irvine.  I'd stay again.",RS191714128,2012-08-31
"My family and I stayed for three nights on a short vacation.  We had a few rooms for which we paid a little over $100/night for each room, which was a bit below average for the area.  Front desk staff was polite and helpful. The hotel is starting to seem old.  Little things like walkways needing to be pressured washed, handrails in need of paint and just basic maintenance.  The rooms could use freshening up.  They just felt a bit outdated.  Door lock card reader worked but you had to insert the key card a few times to get the door to open.  I did not smell the Chinese food that others have mentioned.  The hotel did include a modest breakfast which was a nice touch.  Not sure I would stay there again.  I think I would rather pay a bit more for a nicer/newer place.",785TomS,2012-08-20
"I stayed for 4 nights on a business trip.  Why I picked a Quality Inn considering my last experience with them in San Diego is beyond me but this one was a step up from the last one.  The grounds need some cleaning.  When walking up the steps to check in you can see there are alot of old drink stops that have not been washed in ages and it also looks like the steps haven't been swept in a while.  The room was exactly like the other except the bathroom was alot bigger and at least had more room for your stuff.  The bed was alright.  The breakfast was not too bad had plenty of choices.  If you want to have a drink at the bar has the front desk for a couple of tickets and you can get a glass of wine or beer.  It's clost to the freeway and the 5 minutes to the Irvine Center that has plenty of food, shopping and movies.  Stay out of the gym it is in the basement and creepy.  The equipment did work your better off going for a walk.  And the place had a funny smell from the time you walked in.  It is ok if you are on a budget and I have stayed at alot worse for more money.",virgo1252,2012-08-14
"This is a great place to stay, it is centrally located, prices are good, parking great, nice, helpful staff...everyone.  Noise level was not a problem even though it was close to I5/405 split, I'm a very light sleeper.  Easy freeway access, many restaurants within easy walking distance.  Breakfast - had plenty of items to choose from but I'm not a big breakfast eater, they kept the breakfast items warm and replenished often.",Joanie1014,2012-07-03
"I stay at Quality Inns often. This is one of THE BEST! Convenient location, friendly staff, pool, jacuzzi, spacious room, HDTV, couch, m/w, reefer, clean and modern and inexpensive. My room was nearest freeway w/ no noise issues, and on top floor (3rd) so I had high ceiling. High marks for everything ""important"" but... jacuzzi was only tepid and jets didn't work, breakfast was typical, but coffee was cold and proprietary waffles were ""flimsy"". I'll be back!",CTBurke,2012-07-02
"I stayed there for a week. Everyone was fantastic. Good Vibe!
The rooms were clean and decent.
Only negative remark would be to get new BACON noone likes Shoe String Bacon.
Free Happy Hour Drinks At the Bar if you're a guest, Awesome!",AngelitoBurrito,2012-04-19
"Bankrupt Films invaded the Quality Inn & Suites last week and our trip went off without a hitch.  The entire staff is friendly, the rooms are clean and they have complimentary drinks at the bar every day.  How can you disagree with that?  The hotel is located right next to the freeway and Lynda, the manager, personally went out of her way to make sure we had a great stay.  Can't wait to work down there again!",RobertD747,2012-04-19
This hotel is easy to get to off the 5 and is comfortable  enough. Breakfast is standard but adequate. Staff very nice and rooms clean ,drinkmilkCa,2012-03-11
"I previously reviewed this hotel in June 2011, and stayed here again through the holidays from about mid December through the first week of January 2012. 

As before, this hotel in the Choice Hotel chain is quiet, a great place to de-stress after long work stretches, or for travelers, or seniors just trying to get some peace and quiet away from the grandkids. Not a Party Hotel for the drinking set, but gets plenty of guests who don't mind their absence! Making reservations through the ChoiceHotels.com site worked best for me and was very competitively priced.  

  The Staff and Manager here go really out of their way to be friendly, efficient and professional - and which makes any stay here a real pleasure. Other hotels I have traveled and stayed with aren't nearly so nice usually - some feel  ""customer service"" ends the moment you check in. By contrast - this Quality Inn & Suites makes you feel at home. On some wintery cold nights the smell of their lobby fireplace wafting through the building reminds you of hotels as they used to be decades ago - but with all the modern amenities you expect these days.  The rooms are large, comfortable, very clean and well maintained, the beds are firm and have good heavy blankets - and coffee pots, microwaves and good small refrigerators set it apart really from lesser rated hotels. 

  Breakfast was great as usual, (though half the time I sleep through it- retirement is good for one thing at least!) but when I do get down to the spacious lobby dining area, the food is consistently hot, varied and tasty -and the line (if you go after 7:30 am) moves quickly. There's also a Chinese restaurant near the lobby that offers room service and has very decent prices for those days you just don't want to leave the room. WiFi is good for laptops and Androids, cell phone reception is good also. There's also a small exercise room on the bottom level next to a hot jacuzzi, one floor down from the very clean pool. 

   For a home away from home - this Quality Inn & Suites will be on my list of favorites for a long time.",MCTTravels,2012-01-24
Thank you Quality Inn & Suites very much for making our groups New Years Eve party a success! The staff was very friendly and helpful!  The accommodations were very nice and clean.  I will be coming back to the area in May for a business meeting and will be staying with them again. I have also encouraged co-workers to stay here as well!  Great Job!,SyndyP,2012-01-11
"I stayed with our group over the holidays. The staff was very pleasant and well organized. 
The rooms were clean and comfortable, with plenty of space to move around in. And the breakfast served had plenty of choices for the group.
Enjoyed my stay there and would definetly go back and do it again.",Wineguy1369,2012-01-07
I do a lot of business travel and I havn't seen a staff work as organized and swift yet. The front staff was very busy but the line moved fast and I got my room without a hitch. The room was much better than I expected. For the price I did not expect the number of amenities. I'm just glad they had a coffee machine. One thing I forgot about was the proximity to so meny neat restaurants and things to do. The Spectrum is an upscale mall with just about all you can imagin. This was the second year I'd been here and I look forward to the third or hopefully sooner which looks to be in summer.,BillS964,2012-01-07
We had a great time there New Years Eve.  We had a group of over 100 people.  We had breakfast in the hotel and dinner in their Chinese Restaurant.  This is the fourth or fifth time that our group has been there and we are looking forward to going back again next year.,DianeE285,2012-01-07

Great way to welcome in the New Year.",pams155,2012-01-06
"I was the organizer and we had booked about 1/3 of the hotel. They worked with me often to make sure things went well. The front staff was always professional and did what they could to fulfill all our requirements. They even placed my guest near the banquet room so the noise would be kept to only my guest. For the price you would not believe how nice the place is, tasteful decor in the rooms, the lobby beautiful. The breakfast the next day was lovely, even though the hotel had been fully booked the server was great and tried to accommodate everyone best to her supplies. And the location is perfect and easy to find. Plus it has McDonald's next door for those who want a late night nibble. This was our second year having a party and I would recommend this to anyone, even my Mom who also went to the party and had a great time.",Micr0N,2012-01-05
"When traveling to Orange County, I always stay here. It's not the Ritz but for under $80 per night, it is great. The rooms are clean, quiet and the continental breakfast is always good. Close to the 405 but not right along side of it. Mc D's is next door. They have a Happy hour in the bar (limit 2 drinks, beer or wine)",RoyR937,2011-12-22
"Such a tastefully decorated, seemingly recently upgraded place!  The rooms have nice furniture and comfortable beds, and the bathrooms have laminate counter tops and shower backing...a nice touch...and new toilets.  Wall paintings are  European seaside scenes...nice & airy.  Front desk staff in the afternoon were very helpful and professional.  
The exercise room was simple, but one could still get a bit of a workout wake-up!  (2 exercise machines need repair.)  The lounge area and breakfast eating area were spacious enough for gathering and meeting, should one need that.  Breakfast had multiple options, hot and cold.  Balcony was fun to have.  Some rooms were better than others, but front desk was very accommodating.  The plants and foliage were nicely maintained and added a pretty touch.  A nice experience!",HazelDell,2011-10-14
"Our soccer team stayed here during Labor Day weekend for a local tournament.   This was a terrific hotel, with 2 queen beds for $79.99 per night, including breakfast.  The rooms were clean and the beds extremely comfortable.   The staff and housekeepers are very friendly; our room was even cleaned twice one day!   Our kids enjoyed the pool and spa.   Breakfast is okay, with bagels,  bananas, eggs, and yogurt (get there early!).   We loved the proximity to lots of great family dining options, including Round Table Pizza and Panera Bread.  All in all, a very happy experience.",skypark91107,2011-09-12
"Our second stay in less than two months to visit ill family. Front desk clerk on days (a young guy, don't know his name) was VERY accommodating. On each trip the first room offered had a strong chemical cleaning odor (and one room was by the pool -- bad choice). When I complained, both times the clerk switched us to quieter and just as clean but near-odorless room. If not for him, we would have left, and missed an otherwise great visit. Breakfast is acceptable (cereals, eggs, waffles, fruit, etc). Rooms were clean and quiet. Air conditioner worked well. Balcony was a nice touch.  We expect to have to return to OC in the near future. We will stay here again.",RichardM252,2011-08-28

It offers guests a large pool area with a seperate large hottub area that can be reached by stairs or elevator.  The complimentary drinks in the evening is a nice touch and allows you to relax and chat with the other guests. The onsite restuarant was notable (even to our guests who do not normally eat Chinese food.)  The complinetary breakfast was enjoyable with hot and cold choices.",JadesJewels,2011-07-08
"Stayed here for a prolonged period (3 1/2 weeks) in May and June 2011 while vacationing and checking out the local resorts by the beach (5 miles away) scene. From Day One through the end of my stay--  I felt the hotel staff made me welcome, were friendly and professional, and knew how to keep you comfortable. ""Jim"" at the front desk was especially great - by the second day he knew me on sight - and greeted me by name. I haven't had that even at the Hilton! Thanks Jim! 

My room was a King Non-Smoking - Executive Suite (King Bed, work area and table, mini-fridge, microwave, wide screen tv, sofa and office style chair.  -- Very Clean- modern, well lit, sliding glass & screen door to the balcony patio -was very welcome for fresh air. The bed was comfortable, good pillows, heavy-weight blankets, fresh clean sheets and towels, and the bathroom was also very modern and clean. The heater worked fine, as did the air conditioner. The TV has a twin movie channel (ENCORE)which plays two different movies each day, CNN news and local news channels, and the usual fare of California TV channels. Free WiFi attracted me and worked flawlessly even late at night, and the Hot Breakfast was great - eggs, make yourself waffles, pastry, orange or apple juice, yogurt, - all fine. (The coffee- for me- wasn't strong enough - but ok). OVERALL I'd rate this Motel/Hotel FIVE STARS. Definitely worth your time!  

Note:  There's an average Chinese restaurant in the hotel - with ""average"" food. Ok if you are too tired to go out--but when I travel--I'm a bit of a gourmand and prefer much better dining - which in the Irvine Marketplace - just to the north off I-5 - is fantastically better. 

About a mile East on Rockfield Blvd -there's dozens of very decent restaurants also- and a very large plaza along El Toro Road for other kinds of shopping.  Ask""Jim"" at the Hotel Desk where ""anything"" is - and he'll give you written instructions on getting there!   

Other local motel/hotels in the area charge even twice as much - but I've found that the Quality Inn & Suites in Lake Forest can easily stand up to any of them for comfort, beat all of them in price, and match any in professionalism. I WILL be back.",MCTTravels,2011-06-04
"Booked a room for a night out with my wife.  Exceptionally professional & courteous staff at check in.  Very clean, fresh smelling, decently furnished rooms.  Bathroom was sparkling & well stocked.  Good water pressure in the shower.  Comfortable bed & pillows, not too soft or hard.  Not any noise/disturbance from other rooms.  Included hot buffet breakfast was adequate for the AAA price we paid.  Enough free parking, easy access from fwy.  The AC was a little noisy, & they could replace the tube tvs with flatscreens.  They have a stay 2 nights & get 3rd free deal so we'll be back soon.",MSK69,2011-05-31
"My fiancee and I recently had the pleasure of staying at this surprisingly accommodating hotel, it is centrally located right off of the 5 freeway close to just about everything. I went to High School in Lake Forest and never had the pleasure of exploring the hotel until now and I can assure you it does impress! It is quite affordable and as with all Choice Hotel brands everything was exceptionally clean and the property was very well maintained. The clerk at the front desk welcomed us warmly and the night auditor was exceedingly helpful when we checked out early. The only single drawback of the room was that the faucet in the bathroom was barely long enough to hang over the sink and consequently you cannot avoid bumping your hands on the sink while trying to wash them- nothing a little update couldn’t fix- other than that my only suggestion is an upgrade to flat screen LCD televisions but the room was just fine without one.",tsmoore88,2011-05-27

"I stayed at the hotel for two nights while I was in the area for a concert at the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater and chose this for its proximity to the venue plus the reasonable rates. The service was tremendous and very helpful in getting me checked in, and the breakfast was very good consisting of waffles, eggs and sausages. Let me tell you it was nice getting a hot breakfast in the morning. 
The room was very comfortable and clean. I slept really well. I have had some hotels where the beds where miserable to sleep on but not here. The bed was comfortable and the sheets were clean. 
I liked how the hotel was close to restaurants especially the Buffalo Wild Wings that was just down the block. It was nice having a place where I can go to dinner and have a few drinks without worrying about driving back to the hotel in a new city.
The only thing that I had a minor issue with was that the shower head didn't seem to secure, and not properly caulked in since I could pull it out a few inches from the wall when I tried to adjust the shower head but like i said that was a minor issue and didn't really spoil my stay here at all. 
The next time I am in town for a concert at Verizon I am definitely staying here again.",JHabib,2011-02-06
Hotel accomodations were great. Front desk clerk at night was awesome. She was very helpful but I overheard her lady boss raising her voice on her while standing behind the front desk which I really think was very unprofessional. Didnt get the boss name but I was not happy to see that. Other than that my stay was great.,cali_pat2003,2010-12-15
"We stayed last weekend with our daughter's soccer team.  All of the parents kept commenting about how nice the hotel was for the price we paid.  Clean rooms, excellent customer service, great breakfast options for the girls and convenient location.  I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone staying in the area and our soccer team will definitely return again next year!",Tourist803747,2010-09-08
"My husband, dog, and I were traveling along the coast for vacation and to hit as many Dave Matthews shows as possible in 2010.  This hotel was one of the nicest we stayed in.  The bathroom looked like it had just been remodeled and the main bedroom was spacious.  Upon arriving there were a ton of kids there for a soccer tournament and thought it would be noisy but we had no issues. Great location too!  Close to Irvine Spectrum mall, easy drive to Laguna Beach, and only about a 2 minute drive to the Verizon Wireless Amphitheater.",Betsyin85308,2010-08-25
"Thank you for everything your hotel was one of the best of I have ever stayed at , and especially because of your Customer Quality of Service... Jim at the front desk was absolutely amazing and very helpful.",MissPanda22,2010-08-16
"I have stayed at this hotel twice over the past couple of months, with my last visit being in August 2010.  I enjoyed my visit both times, and would highly recommend this property to other travelers.  Only suggestion I would have to the current owners is to insulate the property from the aroma coming from the resturant on the 1st floor.  It is a little strong at times.  However, everything else was great, and I would definitely return if visiting south OC again.",jaghomeva,2010-08-14
"We stayed a total of 5 days, split over two weekends.  On our return weekend, the rates had gone up due to a local meeting and all hotels being totally booked.  However, the staff kindly reduced our nightly rate to that which we had paid the weekend before.   The rooms are clean and totally fine for the price paid.",Birdiebear188064,2010-08-14
I was very happy with this hotel.  The on line description fit the real place very well.  It was close to everything I wanted to do.  The staff was most helpful and the room an breakfast area was clean and great.  Even the cocktail hour was good. Would go back in a heartbeat and will recommend it to my friends.,41sunshine,2010-08-13
"Hotel is very pretty.  Lobby is beautiful.  McDonald's so close I thought we were parked in their parking lot!  Lady at desk, nice, but rough around the edges!  Gave us our key, went up to the room....TV on and suitcases....someone else already assigned to room.  Sat in hallway with kids while husband got us another room.  Bathroom was small.  Sink was outside of toilet and shower area.  Room was a tad small, but fine. Breakfast area was large, but still crowded.  Man filling the food was terrible at it.  Couldn't keep up.  Dropped huge boxes of plasticware on counter because he couldn't even keep those filled.  There were round eggs that were gross, sausage, cereals, breads, juices, coffee, and waffles.  There are two waffle makers....second one was over on the other counter, nobody noticed it at first.  Lots of little bugs flying around....probably because doors were open when we arrived the night before.  Chinese restaurant on property, didn't eat there.  Overall....good stay.  Stayed here because it was near Wild Rivers Water Park....literally like three minutes up the road.  Just stayed one night.  Was the most expensive hotel we stayed at during our trip to California from the east coast.  Payed about $130 with AAA discount. Nieghborhood was nice and felt safe.  There was an outdoor pool, but we didn't use it. Internet didn't work with my new lap top.",gymath,2010-08-10
"Very good hotel, wel taken care off.
Friendly staff, good breakfast and lovely rooms. Not a bad thing to say about.
Would definetely recommend!",Juuls27,2010-06-19
"If you just need a place to stay and don't require anything fancy, this is the place for you. There's a small pool, but I didn't swim in it. The water looked kind of cloudy. But I wasn't there to swim anyway. The hotel has a weird setup in that some of the hallways are open-air, so you're outside in some of the hallways to your room. That can make it kind of loud at times in your room (if it's near the hall, which mine was) because you can hear people talking and rolling their suitcases down the hall. The room has a sliding glass door that leads out to a very small balcony that seemed kind of pointless to use because you couldn't see anything except other rooms (at least where I was). The breakfast included with your stay was a plus, though it's just prepackaged danishes, toast, cereal, yogurt, fruit, sausages and mushy hash browns. And coffee, tea, juice and milk. Better than nothing. There's free wi-fi, but my connection worked only sporadically. There's a computer and printer in the lobby that you can use, though. The night light in the bathroom was a nice touch. I saw in some of the other reviews people complaining about the smell of Chinese food from the on-site restaurant. You can smell it near the restaurant, but it's not that bad. Perhaps that's because my room wasn't near the restaurant--the smell didn't carry over that far. I would stay here again if I needed an inexpensive place to stay. It's located between a gas station and a McDonald's if that matters to you.",mln27,2010-01-01
"This stay has to be the worst. The TV did not work when I arrived switched rooms, could not get a hold of front desk many times, no answer, refridgerator did not work, lost food, staff did not seem to care or offer to help how to show how things worked. Maid put my blankets on the floor, and then on the bed. Staff hardly speaks English. Not shown how phone works. 800 line did not work. Bird poop near the pool, on railings, on balcony on floor surrounding pool.  Argumentive manager did not try to do better but argue he was right.  Staff at front desk not there a lot of times. I saw them on the computers a lot. Ran out of eggs 7:20 in the morning at breakfast.  No cable, no premium channels can do better for the money. Hot tub broken.  Was told by front desk the laundry worked it did not. Staff at front desk lied to me and said they did not know the managers name, but they gave the name to my father when be called. Unfriendly staff, musky smell in hall ways.  

Do yourself a favor and check out La Quinta or other, for they care about their customers...and will do whatever it takes to keep them...
..fix problems....Best West LakeForest does NOT CARE!!!",smartgalfreqtraveler,2008-10-11
"I am usually tolerant of economy motels, but I would not go back here.  To be fair, the property looked nice, and it was clean. The water pressure was good, and the iron and fridge were in working order. The bagels were fresh.  And I paid only $109 for a room with 2 queen beds.  But...

First of all, it was very humid inside. The weather outside was not, so it was clearly an issue at the motel. The room was strangely shaped, so the air conditioner was actually pointed at an angle towards a wall, rather than into the room, so it didn't help much. In addition, the exhaust fan in the bathroom was not very effective, and it just made the humidity worse.

The bed was uncomfortable, and the pillows were lumpy and flat.  The towels were thin.  

In this age of cable and satellite TV, there were very few TV channels available.

I can see now why motel rooms often have an extra sink outside the bathroom - this one didn't. Traveling with my husband and two sons, I did not have an extra place to do my hair, put on make-up, etc. I even had to move the coffee pot out onto the dresser, and had to announce myself as I opened the bathroom door to get water.

The staff did not replace the cofffee or cups we used on the first day.

Warning: While the water in the pool was nice, the pool had an ""L"" shape, and you couldn't see around the corner. A parent of young children would have to be particularly vigilant.

I thought that Best Western was a higher quality chain than some others in the area, but I was wrong.",Samantha_Marie,2008-07-07
"I stayed in this hotel for business travel. The room was just acceptable - clean, but not much natural light, and a little claustrophobia inducing. The main problem with this place is that there is a Chinese restaurant on the first floor, so the entire place smells of Chinese food. I like the food as much as the next person, but it was nauseating to smell it all the time. Plus I saw someone drying noodles over a bucket outside (seriously). 

The pool did not look like something most people would want to swim in. 

A colleague of mine got stuck in the elevator there for about 10 minutes, and the staff did not seem concerned or apologetic when she finally got out.

I stayed in a room toward the front of the hotel and was OK, but a friend of mine who stayed farther back said she didn't feel safe.

The continental breakfast is a joke - some apples, plastic-wrapped danishes, bad coffee, and hard-boiled eggs (which were my saving grace, incidentally). Generally nasty, and the smell of Chinese food doesn't help.",mudskipper27,2008-04-24
"I stayed here for two nights while my house, three blocks away, was being tented and fumigated for termites.  So obviously the location was ideal - I could easily go home to check my mail and pick up the newspaper out of the driveway!

Overall, I was content.  The room was quite quiet, with the soundproofing good enough to not be bothered by adjacent rooms or from the nearby Interstate 5.  The king bed seemed exceptionally comfortable, and the room heater easily kept the room comfy on a cool, rainy day.  There was adequate storage area, even for my wife, who brought a ridiculous amount of stuff for a short stay.   The wired and wireless internet connectivity let me use my three laptops without incident and with no disconnects.  There were two refrigerators and a two-burner stove which I didn't use.  Lots of more-upscale amenIties: Ironing board/iron, hair drier, coffee maker with proletarian coffee.  There was a sofa-bed couch.  The room was quite full of furniture for its size.  The continental breakfast was adequate, and there was a free ""Happy Hour"" that I used one of the two evenings to unwind with a rather mediocre white zin - I think Inglenook.  

The odd: The building is shaped like a tall ""T"", with the lobby at the base of the T.  I was at the furthest point possible from the lobby - the end of the cross of the T.  And the stairwell right next to my room only went between floors, not to the outside.  So while I might have expected to park near my room, in reality it was a fairly long walk to get to my car because the only hotel entrance is the lobby!

The bad: checkin was slow.  The single desk clerk was apparently processing multiple reservations from a travel agent or consolidator, reading off confirmation numbers as he typed stuff into his computer.  It took about  15 minutes before he would acknowledge me standing there.  The disposable paper-thin plastic glasses were a joke - happily I had brought a mug from home.  The bathtub was surprisingly small, and it had one of those impossible to use (and I'm an engineer) faucets which is either totally on or totally off with the dial rotation somehow adjusting the temperature.  Well, it took me as long as five minutes to figure out how to get passably warm (never hot) water.  The crummy clock radio seemed to be the one universally found in motels and which can barely receive the strongest AM stations without being overwhelmed by hum.  (Again, I brought my own.)  And there were insufficient electrical outlets; almost every one in the room was already used for something.  I coped, but wish I had brought an outlet strip as I often do.

Oh yeah - they allow pets, but at $50 / head I wasn't about to bring the four kitties.  They were boarded at the vet's, a fairly traumatic ordeal for them, but I would have loved to have them in the room.

So these few minor quibbles really don't outweigh the fact that I had a quiet, comfortable stay without spending a fortune.  I'd go back without complaint.

"It was convenient to make reservations, and it was pretty cheap, especially for the area.

BUT....

- My sheets had a funky stain, and there was hair on the bed, from several different people (blonde, brown, long, short)

- The carpet felt like it had been shampooed with hair gel. It was sticky, and it made my feet stick to my sandals... yuck.

- There were tiles falling out in the shower, and it looked like the tub was dirty (footprints and such) but it could've just been old.

- The room was non-smoking, but it smelled pretty strongly of flowery deodorizers on top of old funkiness, and since the window didn't open, the room hadn't been aired out in a very long time.

- The bed was big, but not very comfortable.

- Peeling wallpaper, holes in the walls from pictures that had been removed but not replaced, a funky red splatter pattern on the bathroom wall.

It showed all the signs of a hotel that has long since given up on upkeep.

There's a Chinese restaurant operating on the ground floor that smelled really good, but I didn't get a chance to try it.

"We usually stay in the area and could not get our hotel of choice and they suggested the Best Western.  It was aweful, the hotel has a chinese restaurant with poor ventilation and you can smell the food in the lobby and the walkways it ws disgusting.  

It looked as they just redid the lobby which was nice, but the rooms were terrible.  The worst condition, poorly decorated and the bathroom had avocado green tiles.  The sink was dirty and the hotel just had a terrible feel to it.  

The pool/spa/gym and the whole area was run down with broken concreate and it was just dirty.  I was to stay their for four days, but after the first night I moved to another hotel out of the area.  
This was one of the worst hotel stays I have ever had, it was just dirty.
",jadookissne,2007-05-04
"Their web site says they are committed to excellence, but the hotel was a big disappointment.  Located right off the freeway and noisey - our choice - it was shabby and run down.   If it was clean, it didn't have that impression because the property didn't look cared for.

"My Mom came to visit me from out of town and booked 3 nights here, at $135/night.  They checked her into a room directly above the Chinese restaurant, which as all the reviews have stated, stink up the place something fierce.  Well, this room had a bathroom that looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in a month. When we asked to have the bathroom cleaned, we were told that housekeeping had gone home for the day, and that someone would have to be called to come back in, and that this would take a few hours.  O.K.??.....  When we inquired as to moving her to another room, the only room available was in the main lobby, right next to the front desk.  Well, we found out the hard way, by me trying to call her in the room, that the phone didn't work.  They said they had no replacement, or anyway to fix it.  Needless to say, this is by far the worst experience we've ever had with a hotel/motel, and we have traveled all over the country.  It is an injustice that they charge $135 for a night in their facility. 
We ended up canceling the rest of the reservation after 1 night, and moved to Laguna Woods Lodge, only 1 more exit down the freeway, where the rooms were clean, the staff was very friendly, and the price was only approx. $85 for a single queen bed.
I would not recommend the Best Western in El Toro/Lake Forest under any circumstances.

"I have stayed here before, its not the RITZ CARLTON, but its ok.  Its overnight motel that I stay at.  I always stay usinge my aaa rate around $70, tonight they wanted $189 for the room since there was something going on in the area.  $200 for the same room that is not even worth 50 bucks.  I thought there were rules about price gouging.  When I explained that I have stayed here before the clerk didnt even want to heare about it.  She told me a the new manager wanted a higher rate because they can get it.   Well she may have gotten her extra 100 bucks, but you can sure bet I am not going back here again!

Room 238.

We have just returned from 3 days at the BEST WESTERN LAGUNA EL TORO. It is by far the most un-inviting and dirty place we have ever been to. There is a Chinese Restaurant on the 1st floor that seem to stink up the whole place. The room was so-so. The day after our arrival the toilet overflowed and the whole floor was flooded. It was hard to close the door from the outside. One had to really slam it to close it. We were unable to get more than onetowel per person one wash cloth, and one small hand towel to share. There was a Hot Tub on the 1st floor hiddden under the stairs. That was the most disgusting pool ever soon. It appeared as if it was frequented mostly by transients in the area, whom all had easy access to the tub through a door to the garage that was supposed to be locked and only to be opened by a guest hotel key. 

The ""hotel"" offered a ""Happy Hour"" in a small bar that also served as breakfast room. The service was unbelievable poor. We got there apparently 15 min before the ""Happy Hour"" was over and we had a very hard time getting a cheap glass of wine in a plastic cup. That was our first, last and only visit there. Rarely does one see so many unfriendly faces in one place, here I am talking about the staff. 

If you park in the underground parking area, you may get poop from the exposed sewer lines on your car. We found ""stuff"" to be dripping from several different areas. 

On the floors, the breezeway doors would get stuck after they opened about 8 inches, and they appear to open the wrong way, so in case of an emergency you could be unable to get out.
Elevators were shared with the staff, and thay hasd priority over the paying guests. My advise to prospective guests: DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY THERE.

"I stayed 3 nights there.
I got the coupons from IHOB, just 1 minute away from the Hotel. 
With the Coupon, the price was fantastic.
You can find that price only in a small stinky Super 8 motel.

The room was clean and roomy, the staff were friendly.
The pool was fine, the jacuzzi was in the basement :(
2 minutes from Irvine Spectrum, less than a mile from I-405.
simple breakfast in the morning (free of course).
