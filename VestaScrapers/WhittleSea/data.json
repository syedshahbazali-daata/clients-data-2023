now proposed to update the sequencing table and estimated dates for SOC on the Public Infrastructure Plan to reflect the current delivery program. This is due to delays in the construction of infrastructure assets such as roads, as well as delayed delivery of Lot 11A inclusive of the CAC (Precinct 11A, C1-02). In addition, we note that the delivery of Stage 13A, which provides for the vesting of Section 1 of Patterson Drive (RD-03) and (IN-06), was deferred to prior to SOC of Stage 14 (as per letter from Benup Beuopane Senior Development Engineer dated 3 September 2020).\n\nThe sequencing table has now been updated to ensure that the Stage 13A occurs prior to Stage 14, aligning with the timing agreed to with Council. This approach is consistent with the request from subdivision officer Carolyn Leatham to ensure that the sequencing table accurately reflects the delivery program.","Planning_Officer__c":"0054a000000p16AAAQ","IsVicsmart__c":false,"Application_Type_Text__c":"Secondary Consent Amendment - Planning

I described to you where we wish to install the shed and you said that if I use the Frasers Property (Developer) original drawing showing the exact location of the shed that you could assess this for us. I am attaching the Frasers site layout drawing with the shed location (B2 & BG lines converge). Please contact me if you need any additional information.

Which is 21/06/2021,I think the childcare manager had also report to council, on 28/10/2021, another incident had been report to Department of Education that a fallen branches had hit a child\u2019s head, which this child is like 20 meters away from the tree. Even like 02/02/2022, when I am writing this letter, I can see few branches falling over to the playground. \n\nI would like permission to cut the tree down as it is causing everyone\u2019s stress. It is a lovely tree which blocks all west sun, and give us good shade in the summer, however, looking down from the satellite picture, it is too empty around the tree and it create too much space for winds to blow the trees.","Planning_Officer__c":"0054a000000dc6kAAA","IsVicsmart__c":false,"Application_Type_Text__c":"Secondary Consent Amendment - Planning Application","Submitted_Date__c":"2022-03-03","Application_Type__c":"01t4a000000F1QaAAK","PPARS_Responsibility_Authority_Outcome__c":"Approved","Decision_Date__c":"2022-05-05T01:11:03.000Z","Application_Request_Type__c":"Secondary Consent","Id":"a1l4a000000OoUlAAK","Planning_Officer__r":{"Name":"Daniel Lendvai","Id":"0054a000000dc6kAAA"},"Parent_Application__r":{"Name":"717120/6","Id":"a1l4a0000004osaAAA"}},{"Name":"PLN-38448","Status__c":"Decision Outcome","Property_Address__c":"830 Plenty Road SOUTH MORANG VIC 3752","CreatedDate":"2022-03-03T00:28:02.000Z","Property__c":"a1s4a000001oWLFAA2","Parent_Application__c":"a1l4a0000004oSNAAY","VCAT_Outcome__c":"No Appeal","Description_of_the_Amendment__c":"\u2022\tRedesign of lot 57.

The permeable paving has been relocated, and accurately recalculated to provide the 15% of permeable paving throughout the in-ternal driveway as per the SDA.\n\u2022\tThe amount of permeable paving provided is 17.17% of the internal paving which exceeds the required 15%.\n\u2022\tThe driveway has also been adjusted slightly in areas to improve the vehicle ma-neuverability, in particular the private waste collection vehicle. The turning areas have been increased slightly to avoid the vehicle overhang to encroach the garden beds and landscaping areas.\n\nIn addition to the changes above, throughout the construction documentation stage, the following additional amendment were made due to some minor discrepancies between the plans as well as some adjustments made for construction purposes.\nPlease refer to
